I am a collector of early (typically 19th century and earlier) science, engineering, and math materials. One of my main areas of collecting is early aviation (pre-Wright Brothers).

Some of the bibliographies referenced on this site include

* The History of Aeronautics in Great Britain by  J. E. Hodgeson
