I am a collector of early science, engineering, and math material. I also occasionally buy rare books in science fiction, history, and literature. This site was primarily created as a way to catalog the books in my collection. One of my main areas of collecting at the moment is early aviation (pre-Wright Brothers), so many of the posts will be on this topic.

For any questions or comments or if you just want to chat about books, feel free to send me an email at rarebooksinstem@gmail.com.
