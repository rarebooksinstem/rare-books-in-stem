I am a collector of rare and interesting material in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Some of my main collecting areas include early aviation (pre-Wright Brothers), fluid dynamics, mathematics, ornithology, navigation, horology, and physics. I occasionally also buy scarce and unusual early science fiction, especially if it relates to aeronautics or space travel.

If you have any questions or comments or just want to chat about books, feel free to send me an email at rarebooksinstem@gmail.com.
