I am a collector of rare and interesting material in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Some of my main collecting areas include early aviation (pre-Wright Brothers), fluid dynamics, mathematics, ornithology, navigation, horology, and physics. I occasionally also buy scarce and unusual early science fiction, especially if it relates to aeronautics or space travel.

This site was primarily created as a way for me to catalog the books in my collection. Hopefully, others will find some of the information here useful as well. I've tried to include useful references in each post that go into more detail about a particular book or author.

If you have any questions or comments or just want to chat about books, feel free to send me an email at rarebooksinstem@gmail.com.
