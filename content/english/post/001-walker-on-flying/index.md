My first post is about the book that began my fascination with early aviation. It is the first edition of Thomas Walker's *A Treatise Upon the Art of Flying*, printed in Hull in 1810. It is unfortunate that the frontispiece depicting Walker's flying machine is soiled and has been repaired in this copy. Nevertheless, this copy is particularly interesting because it has been inscribed by Walker to a Tho. Jagues. Auction records show that this exact copy went up for sale in 1986 and sold for about $550.

Little is known about Walker's life. The title page lists his occupation as a portrait painter. J. E. Hodgson's *The History of Aeronautics in Great Britain* contains a footnote stating that "Walker is referred to by a writer in the *Mechanics' Mag.* (vol. xiii, 1830, p. 350) as a 'gentleman of great talent', unassuming but communicative, save in the presence of 'the critic, the wit, or the more heavy part of mankind, who are too tiresome to instruct.'"

The book itself offers little insight into Walker's life. However, it is evident that Walker was little more than an amateur hobbyist when it came to aeronautics, at least when the first edition was printed. His approach to mechanical flight came from dissecting and studying birds and the mechanisms that allowed them to fly. According to him, only two things were needed for sustained flight: large enough wings and enough strength to power them. His idea for a flying machine essentially consisted of planks supporting a chair with wings that could be controlled by a lever to make the wings flap, thus allowing the machine to rise in the air.

There is evidence that Walker built at least one prototype. Hodgson's *History* states that a witness saw the machine Walker had constructed but that he was "unable to raise himself from the platform on which the car was placed." The picture below shows Walker's flying machine from the first edition. It is likely that the machine Walker attempted to demonstrate was based on the second edition of this work.

Copies of the first edition of his work were taken to mainland Europe and America. The first American edition appeared in 1814 and was reprinted in 1816, showing that there was considerable interest in this work.

In the second edition, printed in Bristol in 1831, Walker updated the design for his flying machine. The shape and number of wings changed, and Walker suggested the possibility of adding hydrogen gas in the wings to aid in flight. In this edition, Walker also noted the experiments in mechanical flight taking place across in France and America.

The Aeronautical Society of Great Britain reprinted this work in The Aeronautical Classics, in which both editions of this work appear. In the foreword, the following is written about Walker: 
> <h5>His sole claims to immortality are the two editions of his pamphlet upon flying, which exhibit him as an earnest amateur with a hobby and some small conceit of himself. He fumbles with great truths: knows much, but fails to order his knowledge, and hovers on the brink of great achievements in a way that is quite exasperating. For these reasons his writings are, perhaps, the most fascinating of all those of the pioneers.</h5>

Though Walker isn't as well-known as George Cayley, I have to agree with the quote above. It is clear that Walker was clearly fascinated by the possibility of mechanical flight given that he thought about the problem over the course of many decades.

I'll end by saying that the early-19th-century editions of this work are rare. It is a good thing, then, that some of the pioneers of aviation in the late-19th and early-20th centuries recognized Walker's contributions and decided to inlude this work in several magazines and publications, sometimes in abridged form. It was reprinted in the 1895 edition of *The Aeronautical Annual*, and a stand-alone reprint printed by The Aeronautical Society of Great Britain appeared in 1910 as *The Art of Flying*.
