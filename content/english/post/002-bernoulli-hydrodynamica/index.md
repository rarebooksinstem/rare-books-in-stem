Daniel Bernoulli began writing *Hydrodynamica* in 1729 while in Russia, and it was eventually published in 1738 in Strassburg. In *Hydrodynamica*, Bernoulli puts forth a theory of forces and motions for incompressible flow. Bernoulli states in the first chapter that the theories of stagnant fluids and fluids in motion are linked, and he proposes describing them both under the category of hydrodynamics. While much of the book is dedicated to the study of fluids, there is a chapter on the kinetic theory of gases.

There are some noteworthy things to mention about the title page. It states that Daniel is the son of Johann and that he is, at the time of the book's publication, an honarary professor at the Imperial Academy of Sciences of Petropolis (St. Petersburg) (Academia Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitinae). The engraving was done by Johann Martin Weiss, the type by Johann Heinrich Decker, and the book printed by Johann Reinhold Dulsecker.

What is now known as Bernoulli's principle can be found in chapter 12. The relevant pages and figure are shown below. The original derivation and result can be hard to understand because they appear in a different form than what students today are used to. For a more detailed analysis, see "3. The Bernoulli Equation in the *Hydrodynamica*" in chapter 9 of *Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics*.

There are a couple of English translations that I am aware of. One is a 1968 edition by Dover Publications that includes both Daniel Bernoulli's *Hydrodynamics* and Johann Bernoulli's *Hydraulics*. The "Preface to the English Translations" section by Hunter Rouse is particularly insightful. A free translation of *Hydrodynamica* by Ian Bruce is available online [here](https://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/dbernoullicontents.htm).
