Daniel Bernoulli began writing *Hydrodynamica* in 1729 while in Russia. The Soviet Academy of Science still has the incomplete manuscript. This work was eventually published in 1738 in Strassburg.

The title page mentions that Daniel is the son of Johann and that he is, at the time of the book's publication, an honarary professor at the Imperial Academy of Sciences of Petropolis (St. Petersburg) (Academia Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitinae). The engraving was done by Johann Martin Weiss, the type by Johann Heinrich Decker, and the book printed by Johann Reinhold Dulsecker.

There are a couple of English translations that I am aware of. One is a 1968 edition by Dover Publications that includes both Daniel Bernoulli's *Hydrodynamics* and Johann Bernoulli's *Hydraulics*. A free translation by Ian Bruce is available online [here](https://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/dbernoullicontents.htm).
