*Mechanica* was written and published during Leonhard Euler's time in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he worked at the Academy of Sciences. Along with Isaac Newton's *Principia* and Joseph-Louis Lagrange's *M&#233;canique Analytique*, it is one of the most important treatises on classical mechanics. Euler noted the limitations in the geometrical approach of Newton and Christiaan Huygens and put forth an analytical approach to mechanics. The first volume studies the motion of free bodies acted upon by external forces, and the second volume deals with motion that is constrained to a confined path.

The following passage from *A History of Mechanics* by Ren&#233; Dugas illustrates Euler's intent.

> <h5>Euler attempted to show that the composition or the equivalance of forces in statics could be be extended to their dynamical effects. In fact, he was here concerned with a postulate. He also distinguished between <i>absolute</i> powers, such as gravity, that acted indifferently on a body at rest or in motion, and <i>relative</i> powers, whose effects depended on the velocity of the body. As an example of such a power, he cited the force exerted by a river on a body - this force disappears when velocity of the body is the same as that of the river.</h5>

As far as this particular copy is concerned, it is special because it was once owned by Paul St&auml;ckel and bears his nameplate. St&auml;ckel was a mathematician who editted the collected works of Euler and translated some of Euler's (among others) works to German. [MacTutor](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Stackel/) has a great biography of him. Of note is another mathematician who owned this copy, Emanuel Gabriel Bj&ouml;rling. His signature can be seen, along with those of St&auml;ckel and a couple others, in the image below.

Ian Bruce has an English translation of both volumes available online for free ([volume 1](https://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/mechanica1.html) and [volume 2](https://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/mechanica2.html)). I especially recommend reading his translator's preface for some context on Euler's approach.
