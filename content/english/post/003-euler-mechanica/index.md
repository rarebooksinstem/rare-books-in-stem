*Mechanica* was written and published during Leonhard Euler's time in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he worked at the Academy of Sciences. Euler noted the limitations in the geometrical approach of Isaac Newton and put forth an analytical approach to mechanics.

This is a particularly interesting copy of Leonhard Euler's *Mechanica* because it was once owned by Paul St&auml;ckel and bears his nameplate. St&auml;ckel was a mathematician who contributed to the collected works of Euler and translated some of Euler's (among others) works to German. [MacTutor](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Stackel/) has a great biography of him. Of note is another mathematician who owned this copy, Emanuel Gabriel Bj&ouml;rling. His signature can be seen in the image below.
