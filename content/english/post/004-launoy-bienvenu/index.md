This pamphlet was printed only a year after the Montgolfier Brothers' public demonstration of a hot air balloon in 1783. It advertises a helicopter prototype that Launoy, a naturalist, and Bienvenu, a mechanic, built and exhibited in front of the Academie des Sciences in 1784. Buying this pamphlet also gave the purchaser access to see three models at Bienvenu's house on Rue de Rohan in Paris. One was the model exhibited before the Academie, the second was a model three times its size, and the third was a model of another proposed flying machine. (See J. E. Hodgson's <i>The History of Aeronautics in Great Britain</i>.)

The model exhibited before the Academie was simple and consisted to two superposed screws, each with four feathers. When a cord connected to two ends of a small bow was wound and then released, the two screws rotated in opposite directions, canceling out the horizontal forces and combining the vertical ones to create lift.

According to the balloonist Nadar, this experiment was quickly forgotten, though no reason is given (<i>The Right to Fly by Nadar</i>, translated by J. S. Harry). Launoy and Bienvenu had also planned to build a larger model and go up in it themselves, though there's no evidence to suggest this model was ever built. Most likely, their experiments convinced them that they couldn't generate enough motive power to lift a person. Also interesting to note is that Sir George Cayley built a similar prototype in 1796, though it's not clear if he was influenced by Launoy and Bienvenu.

This copy of the pamphlet is in contemporary blue wrappers, though a couple of the corners have been restored. It is housed in a calf-backed chemise with a matching slipcase. Given the ephemeral nature of this pamphlet, it's likely that only a few copies survive.
