Mark Ridley was a physician who took an interest in magnetism, probably because of his acquaintance with William Gilbert, a physicist who conducted many experiments on magnetism to show that the earth itself is a giant magnet with magnetic poles. This book is essentially Ridley's way of promoting Gilbert's ideas from his *De Magnete*. It discusses the properties of magnets and gives instructions for performing various experiments with magnets/loadstones. As an aside, *De Magnete* was printed in 1600 and hadn't been translated into English at that point. Another scientist, William Barlow, remarked that Gilbert's experiments should first be proven before translating the work. Barlow did note that getting hold of circular loadstones for experiments in London was very challenging at the time.

Of particular interest are the twenty-one engravings, including a depiction of Virginia/New England and Australia and another figure that looks a lot like magnetic field lines. Another thing to note is that Ridley was a believer of Copernicus' theory of heliocentrism and was thus attacked by some contemporaries who rejected Copernicus.

This particular copy comes from the Frank Streeter library and was sold at auction in 2007. It is bound in modern calf with a leather label stamped in gilt. There are some condition issues to note. The title page has been laid down on a backing sheet, and this copy is missing the volvelle found on page 137.

Nicholas Okes, the printer of this book, was known for printing works of English drama, history, science, and literature. He was apprenticed to William King for eight years before becoming a master printer on April 19, 1606. *A Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers* says he operated from 1606 until his retirement in 1639. He died in 1644.
