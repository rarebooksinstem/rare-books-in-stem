Printed 101 years after the first edition of Isaac Newton's *Principia*, Joseph-Louis Lagrange's *M&#233;canique Analytique* was a giant leap forward in the use of analytical methods to solve physics problems. Central to this work is the idea of virtual work, which Lagrange reduced to its general analytical form from the principle developed by Jean d'Alembert in *Trait&#233; de Dynamique*. However, d'Alembert rarely used this principle in his works. He was attempting to get rid of the concept of force in mechanics, and this principle depends heavily on forces.

It should be noted that, even before writing this work, Lagrange was known to Euler and d'Alembert as a great mathematician, and he corresponded with both of them. The title page of the first edition of *M&#233;canique Analytique* lists Lagrange's membership at various academies in Europe, where he taught and won several prestigious prizes. The title page of the second edition from 1811 lists the various titles he acquired over the previous couple decades.

One of the most interesting things about this work is that, as Lagrange notes in his introduction, no figures of any kind are to be found in its contents because the methods he presents don't require any geometrical constructions. Only algebraic operations are necessary for mechanics. Another unique thing about the book is that Lagrange provides historical context before diving into his analysis, for example, discussing the approaches of Archimedes and Galileo in the first chapter.

*M&#233;canique Analytique* was very well-received and remains to this day one of the greatest works in mathematics and physics. Sir William Hamilton called this work "a kind of scientific poem" (*Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society*, 1834), and John William Sullivan, in *The History of Mathematics in Europe*, called it "the most beautiful mathematical treatise	in existence." Ernst Mach said that analytical mechanics "was brought to its highest degree of perfection by Lagrange" (*The Science of Mechanics*, second edition, translated by Thomas J. McCormack). James Clerk Maxwell was also influenced by Lagrange's approach and used it in *A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism*. In *A History of Science, Technology, & Philosophy in the 18th century*, Abraham Wolf says that this work "occupies a place in the history of the subject second only to that of Newton's Principia." 

Note that some sources say the first edition was printed in two volumes. However, this is not true. This only came as a two-volume set starting with the second edition of 1811. This particular copy came from a private collection from France and comes in half calf over marbled boards with marbled endpapers. It has been rebacked.
