*Ornithologia Nova* was written by an unknown author, though there are many similarities with The Ornithology of Francis Willughby, printed in 1678, so it's very likely the author was familiar with Willughby's work.

The book starts by talking about the general biology of birds and then goes into more details about each bird, including coloring, eating habits, where they're found, and, in some cases, how they taste. Many of the accounts are based on stories by travelers such as William Dampier. There are over three hundred woodcuts throughout the two volumes. Some may say the woodcuts are crude, but I think there's a certain charm about the way the birds are depicted.
