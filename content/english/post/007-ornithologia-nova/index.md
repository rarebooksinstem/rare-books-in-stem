*Ornithologia Nova* was written by an unknown author, and the two-volume first edition was printed in Birmingham in 1743 and 1745. Thomas Warren, the printer, began selling and possibly printing books in Birmingham as early as 1728 and became one of the most important printers in town. Much of the material he printed appears to be lectures and sermons.

There are many similarities between *Ornithologia Nova* and *The Ornithology of Francis Willughby*, which was first printed in 1678. In fact, Willughby is cited several times in the introduction of this book. A second edition of the first volume of *Ornithologia Nova* was printed in 1744 and a third in 1745.

The book introduces the subject by talking about the general biology of birds. The author then goes into more details about each bird, including coloring, eating habits, where they're found, and, in some cases, how they taste. Each entry is accompanied by a woodcut of that particular bird. Many of the accounts are based on stories by travelers such as William Dampier and Ferdinand Magellan and thus contain inaccuracies. There are over three hundred woodcuts throughout the two volumes. Some may say the woodcuts are crude, but I think there's a certain charm about the way the birds are depicted. Below are some examples of the woodcuts.

One of the more interesting descriptions in this book is that of the dodo. Even though it is widely accepted that the dodo was extinct by 1700, the author writes as if the dodo can still be found in the Isle of St. Maurice. Even by the mid-17th century, sightings of the dodo were rare. Like Willughby's Ornithology, the description of the dodo here seems to have been taken from popular sources from the 17th century.

There are two bookplates from previous owners in this copy. The bookplate of John L. Pakington family crest, the bookplate bears the motto "Fidelis et Audax." The other bookplate is that of Graham Manners Lutton. The peacock is featured on many bookplates of members of the Manners family.
