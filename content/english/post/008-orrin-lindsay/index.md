This is an obscure early work of science fiction by J. L. Riddell that didn't really gain a lot of attention until about 100 years after its publication. The book is very short at 33 pages and is in the form of a series of letters by Orrin Lindsay, who is said to be a former student of Riddell's. Lindsay invents some kind of substance that is unaffected by gravity and coats his balloon with it to enable him to fly great distances. He takes two trips up in his balloon, the first one a few miles high and the second one all the way to the moon. He and his passenger orbit the moon a few times before heading home. The moon is described as having numerous craters, mountains, chasms, and volcanoes. Lindsay and his passenger witness one of the volcanoes actively erupting. There are no signs of life.

The return to Earth is quite eventful, and Lindsay and his passenger pass over many countries and continents (including the south pole). The tale concludes with Lindsay suggesting his next trip should be to Mars, which has a much higher chance of hosting life because of its atmospheric conditions. Perhaps, Lindsay says, there might even be intelligent life that is "ten thousand years in advance of us in arts and sciences" and that might be willing to engage in interplanetary commerce.

This copy is housed in a clamshell box. The wrappers are soiled and have several chips, and there is some browning to the pages. It is presumed that the gray-green wrappers are original. While this copy was printed in New Orleans, the book appears to have also been printed in Louisville by J. C. Noble. The priority between these two is unknown.

This is an early example of hard science fiction, with fairly in-depth details about some of the underlying principles that allow the balloon to fly. There's even some math to be found, as shown in the picture below.

J. L. Riddell was a lecturer, scientist, and doctor who is perhaps most famous for his contributions to botany. He discovered several new species of plants and also invented the binocular compound microscope. Of his many works, this one is perhaps his strangest.
