This first edition of Giovanni Battista Venturi's *Recherches Experimentales Sur le Principe de la Communication Lat&#233;rale du Mouvement dans les Fluides* is surprisingly hard to find given its importance in the field of hydrodynamics. It was printed in 1797 and contains a series of experiments conducted by Giovanni Battista Venturi while teaching at the University of Modena as a professor of philosophy. Venturi notes that these experiments were conducted in front of an audience at the Philosophical Theatre of Modena, and every experiment was conducted multiple times to remove any doubts of error. These experiments were necessary and important because the theory of solid mechanics could not be accurately applied to fluid flow.

Venturi puts forth twelve propositions relating to the motion of fluids, and all are supported by experimental results. The most famous of these propositions is that the pressure of a fluid moving through a constricted area decreases and the velocity increases. Venturi's proposition is a direct result of Daniel Bernoulli's principle, first published in 1738 in his book *Hydrodynamica*. (Though Venturi doesn't mention it, this proposition is only applicable for subsonic flow. For supersonic flow, constricting the flow actually decreases the velocity. Figure 12 shows what sort of resembles a modern wind tunnel for testing supersonic flow. The fluid enters through the left at a low speed, and its speed is gradually increased through a series of constrictions and expansions until supersonic speeds are reached.)

Another interesting proposition is Proposition X, where Venturi discusses eddies in rivers. He writes that "few authors have examined the cause and the effects of the eddies of water in rivers; and those who have undertaken this investigation, do not appear to be very happy in their researches" (translation by William Nicholson, see below). Venturi states that eddies are caused by motion communicated from faster parts of the current to parts that are moving more slowly. Figure 19 shows an example of an obstacle that would cause an eddy. An example of another type of eddy first described by Charles Bossut is mentioned in Proposition XI and occurs in the experimental setup shown in figure 18.

Proposition XII is also notable because it mentions that the behaviors associated with the flow of water can also take place in the air, such as smoke rising from a furnace or wind flow around a mountain.

An English translation of the entire work by William Nicholson was first made available in 1799 and printed by J. Taylor in London as *Experimental Enquiries Concerning the Motions of Fluids*. In a February, 1798, issue of *Journal of Natural Philosophy*, Nicholson notes that Venturi sent him a copy of this work. He gives the work a glowing review and says that "there is no doubt but that the whole work will tend to confirm the reputation of its author as a skillful experimentalist, and enlightened observer." Nicholson's English translation was later reprinted in *Tracts on Hydraulics*, edited by Thomas Tredgold.
