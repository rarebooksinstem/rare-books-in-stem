Since the very moment it was shown that people could float in the air by means of a balloon, it became apparent that guiding the balloon in any direction was a very challenging problem. In 1784, the Academy of Lyons proposed a prize on the subject of aerial navigation of a balloon, and by March 1785, 101 essays had been submitted. However, "not one was considered worthy of the prize" (Hodgson's *The History of Aeronautics in Great Britain*). Joseph MacSweeny notes in *An Essay on Aerial Navigation* that an essay by Louis-Sebastian Lenormand could offer a potential solution. Lenormand proposed using steam that escapes at horizontal angles from the diameter of the balloon. However, the weight of the water and fuel would be too great for the balloon to even lift off the ground. (This is a problem that plagued the aeronautics community throughout the 19th century.)

MacSweeny was one of many who published an early study on this problem. He was a doctor by profession and lived in Cork, Ireland, but not much is known about his life. The first edition of this work was printed in 1824 under the title *An Essay on Aerial Navigation, with Some Observations on Ships*. It was printed in Cork by King and Company, and the author is listed as "J. M'S." By MacSweeny's own admission, the first edition was written in haste and was lacking in many ways, mainly because MacSweeny didn't fully appreciate the difficulties in aerial navigation.

The second edition was greatly expanded to tackle the problem of steering balloons. In many ways, the challenges MacSweeny mentions in this essay are the same challenges that, a few decades later, engineers and inventors faced with heavier-than-air flight, namely, the guidance and control of aerial vehicles. MacSweeny begins by giving a history of ballooning, the challenges associated with it, and various inventions, like parachutes and ropes, that have aided ballooning. Four chapters that were new to the second edition include excerpts from a paper on aerostation that MacSweeny read before the Cuverian Society of Cork between June 7, 1837, and January 2, 1839. There are several other papers that MacSweeny published in *Southern Reporter* (I believe MacSweeny is referring to *Cork Southern Reporter* here) and the *Cork Chronicle*, which was a local newspaper. The issues of interest are those of August 26, 1824; November 26, 1835; September 1, 1836; and December 17, 1836, in *Southern Reporter* and September 21, 1835, in *Cork Chronicle*. He includes in this essay excerpts or details from these articles.

MacSweeny was definitely knowledgeable on ballooning given that he included dozens of refereneces to existing literature on the topic, along with a good survey of historical flights, accidents, and important figures. While there's some good history in this book, MacSweeny ultimately didn't present any useful ideas that could have been used to improve aerial navigation, and it's very likely he had no practical ballooning experience. Some of his suggestions for aerial navigation involve tethering balloons together for better control in the air, using parachutes and weights to create resistance to make it easier to steer balloons, and even using falcons as ballast to lower or raise a balloon.

It seems MacSweeny was interested in other areas as well based on references to two papers I came across. In 1835, MacSweeny was awarded a prize by The Royal Irish Academy for "the best essay on the climate of Ireland" (Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, October 21, 1835). He also wrote an article titled "Observations on the Means of preserving Provisions and Goods" in the July 1819 (vol. 54, no. 255) issue of *The Philosophical Magazine and Journal*.
