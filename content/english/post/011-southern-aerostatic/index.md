John Southern's *A Treatise Upon Aerostatic Machines* was printed just two years after the first non-tethered human flight in a Montgolfier balloon. It includes details on calculating the power of ascension of balloons, calculating bouyancy, how to construct a balloon, and the effect of various materials and other variables on balloons. It is a fairly short book at 63 pages, but it contains a lot of good info on ballooning as seen through the eyes of an early pioneer. It includes two folding plates and tables that can be used to calculate the power and weights of balloons of various diameters.

It is hard to find contemporary reviews or commentary on this book. Because of the technical nature of the book and the fact that ballooning was still in its infancy in the late-18th century, someone with a knowledge of ballooning would have had to verify Southern's suggestions to check if they were valid. *The Monthly Review* from July to December of 1785 contains a review of the book. The unnamed reviewer criticizes some of Southern's suggestions and states that Southern hasn't considered all cases where a balloon may burst as it ascends into the atmosphere.

There isn't a lot of info on John Southern. He was seemingly an aspiring musician as well as a surgeon of sorts before Matthew Boulton, an engineer and inventor, recommended Southern come work as James Watt's assistant. (Watt is perhaps most famous for inventing the Watt steam engine, which was instrumental during the Industrial Revolution. The SI unit of power is named after him.) After many years of working as an engineering assistant, in 1810, Southern became a partner at the firm Boulton & Watt. While at this firm, Southern's greatest accomplishment was perhaps inventing the steam engine indicator, a device that draws a diagram of the changing pressure inside a cylinder of an engine. Southern also made contributions to the section on steam engines in the 1814 Encyclopedia Britannica. It seems like Southern and Watt remained good friends until Southern's death in 1815.

In the 1895 volume of The Aeronautical Annual, there is a list towards the end of some of the rarer works in the personal collection of James Means, who was the editor of the journal. Many of the works on that list come up for sale often and aren't too difficult to find (as long as you can afford them). This particular book, however, is certainly one of the rarer items on that list. It has only come up for sale at auction four times since 1920, and the last time was in 1971. This is the only edition of this book.
