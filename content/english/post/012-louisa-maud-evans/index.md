The Cardiff Exhibition was held during the spring and summer of 1896, running from May 2 to September 30. Some of the prominent exhibits including those from the mining, engineering, and maritime industries. The latest developments in electricity and scientific instruments were also showcased. One of the acts was a parachuting performance by Louisa Maud Evans, who went by the stage name of Mademoiselle Albertina.

Louisa, who was born in December of 1881, was hired as a "lady paracutist" by Auguste Gaudron to make a balloon ascent over Cardiff and descend using a parachute. She had no previous experience in ballooning or parachuting, and Gaudron did not ask for proof of her training before allowing her to perform this stunt. On the day of the event, July 21, 1896, it was reported that the wind was very strong, and Louisa was carried out into the Bristol Channel while flying at a great height. She eventually jumped out of the balloon and was able to open the parachute, which slowed her fall into the channel. She landed in the water and was covered by the parachute. Despite having a life belt on, she drowned under the weight of the parachute, which was made of heavy cloth and wood. Her body was found washed ashore a few days later. The autopsy noted that there were no dislocations or fractures and that she most likely lost consciousness when she went into the water. Louisa was buried at Cathays Cemetery on July 29, 1896, at the age of fourteen. 

Despite the news and publicity around Louisa's tragic death, this memorial card appears to be unrecorded. It is drymounted on a card and has some mild foxing. As noted in the 19th-century book *Practical Letter Writing*, it was customary "to send memorial cards to friends of a deceased person. Such cards have a black border, narrow for the young, wide for the aged." The poem at the bottom of the card also appears on Louisa's tombstone. At the very bottom of the tombstone, the author is listed as "C.T.W." This could possibly be Charles Thomas Whitmell, an educationalist who was working in Cardiff during the time of Louisa's death.
