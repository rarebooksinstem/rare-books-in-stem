This very short pamphlet from 1864 by Matthew Piers Watt Boulton discussing the problem of finding a suitable source of motive power for flight. Steam engines were often suggested during the mid-19th century as a means of powering balloons and even mechanical vehicles, but the weight of the coal, water, and boiler would be too great and the power generated too little. Boulton suggests the possibility of using explosive compounds such as gunpowder or gun-cotton. The weight of the coal, water, and boiler would be replaced by the weight of the explosive, which is much lighter than the three components used by a steam engine.

Boulton notes that there are two problems with using an explosive, one being that the explosion could be dangerous to the balloon/vehicle and aeronauts and also damage the vessels in which the explosive is burned. However, if these problems could be overcome, Boulton notes that using gun-cotton would be advantageous because the velocity of the explosion could be controlled and the engine would be much lighter and more compact than a steam engine generating similar power.

M. P. W. Boulton came from a rich family and was the grandchild of Matthew Boulton, who worked with James Watt to improve the steam engine during the mid-18th century. Despite having studied math, philosophy, and the classics, M. P. W. Boulton eventually turned his attention to aeronautics and registered several patents on the subject, including some on motive power and propulsion. He is perhaps most famous for inventing ailerons, which are used to control the roll (movement along the longitudinal axis) of a plane or any other "aerial vessel."

This copy has the original paper wrappers and includes a loosely inserted postscript stating that more research should be done on explosive compounds to find the most suitable one for aerial locomotion. Bradbury & Evans was one of the most well-known printing offices in London and is most famous today for publishing Charles Dickens starting in 1844.
