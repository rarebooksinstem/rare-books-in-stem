This is a fascinating survival from the 1901 Pan-American Exhibition held in Buffalo, NY. The exhibition ran for 5 months and was attended by over 8 million visitors. Perhaps the highlight of the exhibition was A Trip to the Moon in the airship Luna, an indoor amusement ride created by Frederic Thompson, who was an inventor and engineer.

The spaceship Luna was suspended in the air by cables, and fans and imagery revolving around the spaceship were used to simulate the flight to the moon, during which journey riders were shown images of stars, constellations, and meteors. On the moon, tourists were taken to Moon City and shown "a strange race of Pigmies and Giants" along with dancers of the Moon King's court. A green moon cheese was served to the riders by the pigmies. The images below show some of the scenes riders would have been treated to.

According to this leaflet, the production costs for this ride were $200k, and over 200 people were cast as giants, dwarfs, sailors, etc. It was a very successful attraction, with many "eminent men" of the time, including Thomas Edison, praising the ride. After the exhibition, this ride was moved to Steeplechase Park on Coney Island in New York.
