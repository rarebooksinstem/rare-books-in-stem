This rare handbill was printed and distributed in 1834 to advertise the exhibition of The Eagle, which was an airship designed by Comte de Lennox and intended for travel between the various European capitals. It was 160 feet long, 50 feet high, and 40 feet wide. It was to be manned by a crew of 17 "experimental sailors." The airship had four large paddles on each side that the sailors would row back and forth like a boat. There was an air cushion that controlled the altitude of the ship. It was perhaps the most elaborate attempt to create a steerable airship up to that date.

The Eagle was constructed in 1835 and exhibited that same year at the Kensington and Vauxhall Gardens. During an exhibition in Paris, it failed to ascend from the Champ de Mars and was destroyed by onlookers (presumably because they didn't get what they paid for). The weight of The Eagle was too much to lift. There is no evidence that Comte de Lennox ever tried to fly this airship and nothing to suggest it would have flown had he tried.
