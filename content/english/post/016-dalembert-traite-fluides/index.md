In 1743, Jean le Rond d'Alembert published a treatise on mechanics, which is perhaps his most famous work. In it, he formulated a principle that is now known as d'Alembert's principle. He applied the principles in that book to fluids, and the result was *Traite de l'equilibre et du mouvement des fluides*, first printed in 1744. A second edition appeared in 1770. It is essentially a reprint of the first edition but with minor additions based on d'Alembert's studies since the publication of the first edition.

In the intro, d'Alembert states that Isaac Newton was the first to apply the principles of mechanics to study fluid resistance, though Newton's approach had many shortcomings, and those who studied the problem after Newton had little success in addressing them. He does mention that Daniel Bernoulli had the best knowledge when it came to understanding the difficulties of studying fluids because of how in-depth he went into the problem in his *Hydrodynamica*. I'll note here that Bernoulli disliked d'Alembert's book on fluids because d'Alembert's book was basically a criticism of *Hydrodynamica*. Interestingly, while d'Alembert's results mostly agreed with the results of Bernoulli, he failed where Bernoulli had failed because both had made similar assumptions.

I've read that d'Alembert constantly critized his contemporaries in his works and that his works require multiple readings because of how poorly structured his writing can be. Still, he was well-regarded and respected during his time, especially early on in his career. While not known for his work in fluids, this book provides good insight into how scientists and mathematicians at the time approached fluid dynamics. This book comes up ten plates, some of which are shown below.
