*Astronomia Crystallina* is an extremely scarce anti-Copernican work written by an unknown author, J. H. It was first printed in 1670, and a second edition appeared in 1676. The second edition is a reprint of the first with the addition of a postscript where the author has a back-and-forth dialogue with two skeptics of his theory. Neither the first nor the second edition lists a printer, but the second edition does list two booksellers for whom the book was printed, Nathaniel Brooks and John Hancock.

In this short work of 18 pages (plus an "Ecce to the Diagrams" and a postscript", not only does the author argue against Copernicus' heliocentrism, but he also argues against the Ptolemaic geocentric model. In J. H.'s model, which is based on Nicolaus Reimer's model in his *Fundamentum Astronomicum*, Mercury and Venus revolve around the sun; the sun and the rest of the planets revolve around Earth; and the moon revolves around Earth as usual. The volvelle at the end of the book is meant to demonstrate this. The two pieces were probably connected together by string at one point but are now separated.

I was unable to find any contemporary reviews or discussions of this work. Most likely, it was printed in small numbers. From my reading of the first edition, the author was not a professional astronomer and didn't seem to have access to the latest ideas in astronomy. The most recent astronomer mentioned in the book is Tycho Brahe, who died in 1601. There's no mention of Johannes Kepler, who would have been very well-known in England by the mid-17th century, or John Wilkins, whose *A Discourse Concerning a New World* was printed many times starting in 1638 and was a means to promote Copernicus' ideas to a general, educated audience. In the second edition, there is mention of Jeremy Shakerley's work from the 1650s but no mention of anyone else from the 17th century.

My initial suspicions were confirmed by a reading of the second edition and an article from 1939 about this work. In the second edition, J. H. refers to himself as a "plain Englishman" who has studied the ancient astronomers. No formal training is mentioned. Furthermore, as Grant McColley points out in his essay "J. H. and the Astronomia Crystallina" (printed in the *Annals of Science*, volume 4, issue 3 from 1939), "the fact that a lay writer would twice publish a treatise on astronomy is some evidence of the growing non-professional interest in the field."

Finally, there is the question of authorship. Neither edition gives any clues as to the identify of J. H. I found another book titled *A Treatise of the Great Antidote of Van Helmont* written by a "J. H. a lover of truth" and printed "for the author" in 1667. This book is about an elixir that can help cure various ailments. As with *Astronomia Crystallina*, it also lists no printer and shows that the author has a shallow understanding of the subject matter. While there are some personal details of the author mentioned in this book, they aren't enough to suggest that the authors of the two books are the same person. The other possibility is William Salmon (1644-1713), who published at least one book using the initials J. H. He is known to have written books on a wide range of topics and was described by his contemporaries as a quack.

This book is very scarce in commerce. Aside from a handful of institutional holdings, the only other record comes from a NY auction from 1979, when the second edition sold for $550. This shows there was good demand for this book even back then.
