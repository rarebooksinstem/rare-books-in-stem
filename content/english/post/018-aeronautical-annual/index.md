The Aeronautical Annual was a short-lived journal that was published between 1895 and 1897 and edited by James Means. It includes reprints of articles written by many famous pioneers of aviation, including Octave Chanute, Otto Lilienthal, George Cayley, Samuel Langley, Hiram Maxim, and Means. The first volume contains some of the earliest studies on flight, including an extract from Leonardo Da Vinci's study on birds, papers by Sir George Cayley, and a reprint of Thomas Walker's *A Treatise Upon the Art of Flying*,. The later volumes include some contemporary studies by Chanute, Lilienthal, etc. Each volume also contains a number of illustrations depicting various gliders, kites, apparatus, and schematics. In 1910, *Epitome of the Aeronautical Annual* was published, and it included a selection of the most important articles from the first three volumes.

When this journal was published, there was considerable interest in mechanical flight. As stated by Hiram Maxim in "Natural and Artifical Flight," "Up to within a few years, nearly all experiments in aerial navigation by flying machines have been made by men not versed in science, and who for the most part have been ignorant of the most rudimentary laws of dynamics. It is only quite recently that scientific engineers have taken up the question and removed it from the hands of charlatans and mountebanks. A few years ago many engineers would not have dared to face the ridicule which they would be liable to receive if they had asserted that it would be possible to make a machine that would lift itself by mechanical means into the air." This journal heavily influenced the Wright Brothers as well, and Orville Wright wrote in a letter to Means' son in 1921 that the "Aeronautical Annuals of 1895-96-97 contained the best collection of reprints from the work of the earlier experimenters in aviation...and I do not know of a better collection today."

A complete list of contents for each volume is shown below.

2. *An Account of the First Aerial Voyage in England* by Vincent Lunardi. London, 1784.
3. *The History and Practice of Aerostation* by Tiberius Cavallo. London, 1785.
4. *A Treatise upon Aerostatic Machines* by John Southern. Birmingham, 1785.
5. *An Account of Five Aerial Voyages in Scotland* by Vincent Lunardi. London, 1786.
6. *A Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts* by William Nicholson. 35 volumes. London, 1802 to 1813.
7. *A System of Aeronautics* by John Wise. Philadelphia, 1850.
8. *Reports of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain*. London, 1866-1893.

This set was once owned by William G. Gerhard (1905-1975) and bears his bookplate in all four volumes. Gerhard was a famous collector of early aviation material, especially ephemera.
