Richard Norwood was an English mathematician and surveyor. He became interested in the art of navigation and mathematics as a young man and eventually wound up in Bermuda as part of a colonizing expedition. While there, he conducted an initial survey of Bermuda in 1614, followed by a more thorough survey a couple years later that divided the island into 25-acre tracts for shareholders to farm. This led to an economic boom in Bermuda in the 17th century, and an interesting fact is that the property lines that Norwood came up with are still visible to this day.

This book was written by him as a way to aid sailors in navigation. By using logarithms, many of the complicated calculations required for navigation could be simplified. It is divided into two sections, one dealing with "plaine triangles," or the study of triangles in two dimensions, and the other with "spherical triangles," or spherical trigonometry. The first section is only 39 pages since it summarizes the basic principles of geometry found in many other texts and includes a brief introduction to logarithms. The second section contains a more in-depth discussion on logarithms as well as the application of trigonomtery to problems found in sailing and navigation. Also included at the end of this book are a table showing the declination of the sun from years 1632 to 1647, a table of logarithms, and a table of sines and tangents.

Norwood was heavily influenced by two mathematicians, John Napier, who invented logarithms, and Henry Briggs, who improved on Napier's idea. Considering that Napier's book on logarithms was first printed in 1614, this book is an early example of the application of logarithms (another famous example is Johannes Kepler and his astronomical studies). This book was popular in its time and went through eight editions between 1631 and 1685. 

This copy was owned by two great collectors of the 20th century. Harrison Horblit (1912-1988) collected material in various areas of science. His *One Hundred Books Famous in Science* was published in 1964 and contains titles that he exhibited at the Grolier Club in 1958. After Horblit's death, this copy was bought by Erwin Tomash (1921-2012), a great collector in the history of computing, According to auction records, Tomash bought this copy in 1988 for $6400 from Hans Peter Kraus. After Tomash's death, this copy was sold at auction in 2018 as part of his library of computing collection.
