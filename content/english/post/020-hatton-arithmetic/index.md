Little is known about Edward Hatton's life, and much of what is known comes from the several books he authored. He was born in 1664 and eventually became a surveyor for a fire insurance company in London. It is unclear how he gained knowledge in arithmetic. The first books Hatton wrote were on commercial arithmetic, that is, the use of arithmetic for calculating taxes, interest, and profit and loss.

The first edition of *An Intire System of Arithmetic* was funded by subscribers. Three of the more famous subscribers include Sir Isaac Newton, Dr. Edmund Haley, and Dr. John Keill. Hatton addressed the dedication of this book to Keill, who was a mathematician and astronomer by profession and a Fellow of the Royal Society. Hatton states that his intention for writing the book was to make it easy for newcomers to approach arithmetic and to include some new ideas not found in other arithmetic books written in English.

This book was written during a time when foreign trade was beginning to increase. Thus, there was demand for books about practical mathematics. The book opens with definitions of terms commonly found in arithmetic, followed by the standard addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. There are sections dealing with decimals, fractions, logarithms (including tables), roots, and algebraic equations. The practical sections include discussions on compound interest and bartering.

Hatton does tend to be verbose at times. In *Arithmetical Books from the Invention of Printing to the Present Time," Augustus de Morgan states that this work is "a sound, elaborate, unreadable work." Hatton, though not very well-known today, was popular in his time. Many of his books went through multiple editions. In Duncan J. Melville's "Commercializing Arithmetic: The Case of Edward Hatton," it is noted that Hatton "had a close and open relationship with his publishers and booksellers" and that most of the significant booksellers at the time sold some of Hatton's works (*Research in History and Philosophy of Mathematics*, The CSHPM 2019-2020 Volume). A second edition of this work was printed in 1731.
