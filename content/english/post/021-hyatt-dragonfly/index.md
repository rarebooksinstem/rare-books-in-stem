*The Dragon-fly, or Reactive Passive Locomotion* was written and printed during a time of increased interest in heavier-than-air flying machines. Thaddeus Hyatt was a lawyer by training who went on to become an inventor and abolitionist. His interest in aeronautics dates back to at least the 1850s. In the preface of *The Dragon-Fly*, he states that he offered a reward of $1000 to anyone who could produce "an actual flying machine" during the years 1857-1858. Some of his advertisements on this topic can be found in volume 2 of the *The Architects' and Mechanics' Journal* (1860) and volume 3 of *Scientific American* (1860). However, in this book, Hyatt says that the reward was never claimed.

Like many others interested in aeronautics in the 19th century, Hyatt spent much time studying the motion of birds (there's a section of this book dedicated to bird flight). He took no notice of insects because of their small mass, the problem of aerial navigation being concerned with "tons of matter going through the air." One day, while deep in thought, he was distracted by "the feeling of a material presence about me," which turned out to be a dragonfly. It was then that he wanted to study the mechanical movement of these wings. Some time later, he went to Washington, D.C. to see a flying machine that an old Frenchman had built. However, neither the man nor the machine were to be found. Instead, Hyatt came across yet another dragonfly that he freed from a spider's web, and a couple days later, while on a train from D.C. to Philadelphia, he claims that very same dragonfly entered the compartment that he was sitting in. He managed to trap it in a glass container for some time, though studying it to learn about its mechanism for flight proved fruitless.

Hyatt eventually built four large wings, each nine feet long, out of reeds and calico to further study the wings of a dragonfly. With the help of his brother-in-law and the machinist who had arranged the mechanism for the wings, he proceeded to conduct a flight experiment with the wings. This was done at two in the morning because Hyatt didn't want any spectators. The wings were attached to his back, and he ran down a hill in hopes of generating sufficient lift to raise himself off the ground. However, the experiment resulted in failure. Part of the reason was probably that the entire wing mechanism was much too heavy.

Still, Hyatt was convinced that studying dragonflies was the key to success. Unlike birds, whose aerial motion is very much dependent on external, atmospheric forces, Hyatt theorized that dragonflies can drive their wings at a high velocity to generate a vacuum that allows them to manuever through the surrounding atmosphere in any direction. This is akin to how a fan-blower works. He ends the book by saying that aerial navigation is a problem that can't be solved by one person and requires the efforts of many. Thus, his ideas are free for the service of all mankind, and he encourages inventors to use them as they see fit in hopes they will yield a successful flying machine.

It is stated that this edition had a print run of a "few hundred copies" and was intended for private distribution. Two hundred copies were distributed for general sale. This copy contains an inscription by Hyatt to indicate that it was presented by him to his daughter Bessie Lake Hyatt. In the will of Thaddeus Hyatt, Bessie's address is listed as Ulmenstrasse in Frankfurt, Germany.

This book was printed by Chiswick Press, which was set up in 1811 by Charles Whittingham I. His nephew, Charles Whittingham II, inherited the press in 1840 after his uncle's death. Whittingham II died in 1876, and in 1880, the press was bought by George Bell, who printed material under the name Charles Whittingham & Co. *The Dragon-fly* bears the traditional mark of the Chiswick Press, featuring a lion with the dolphin and anchor associated with Aldus Manutius' Aldine Press.
