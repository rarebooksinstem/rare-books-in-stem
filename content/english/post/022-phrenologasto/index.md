Pretty much immediately after the public ballooning experiments in Paris in 1783, many writers began incorporating balloons in their fiction. One of the earliest depictions of using a balloon for interplanetary travel can be found in *Travels in Phrenologasto* by Giovanni Battista Balscopo, which is the psuedonym of John Trotter. In the preface, the editor of the work claims that he came across this manuscript in 1817 while traveling through Bavaria. One of the servants of the Inn at Ratisbon found the manuscript in a vineyard, and the landlord of the inn then gave the manuscript to the editor since neither the landlord nor the servant knew Italian. It is worth noting that this book is, in fact, not a translation and was originally written in English.

*Travels in Phrenologasto* is a satire on phrenology, which was popular during the early-19th century. Balscopo, the narrator, writes that he took an interest in ballooning early in life and had the great fortune of becoming friends with the famous balloonist Pierre Blanchard. Over fourteen years, he perfected his skills and "constructed a balloon on entirely new principles." He decides to make a solo ascent on November 5 because the national holiday means there would be more spectators. He eventually rises to a great height and falls asleep. Upon waking, he finds himself about six miles from a new planet called Phrenologasto. Luckily for him, the inhabitants of the planet speak Italian. He learns that they are descendants of twelve ancient Egytian families who attempted to fly to the moon but ended up on this planet instead. The most interesting thing is that the heads of every person are studied on their 16th birthday (corresponding to about 21 Earth years) to determine their career prospects and destiny. Balscopo's head is also examined, and after learning that he has no redeeming traits based on the shape of his head, he is granted some leeway given that he's from a more uncivilized planet and assigned to the military class. Over the course of the book, Balscopo learns about their society and customs and meets various characters with different traits and careers that have been assigned to them based on a study of their head.

The first edition, which is extremely scarce, was printed in Calcutta in 1825. Based on a digital copy, the preface that is present in the second edition seems to be missing from the first. The preface is dated April 1829 and states that the author "was a young member of the East India Company's Civil Service in Bengal, who (in the year 1825) sunk, at a very early age, under the influence of the climate of that country."

The second edition was printed by James Kirton and published by Saunders and Otley, which was a partnership between Simon Saunders and Edward John Otley. Between 1826 and 1871, they published nonfiction, fiction, drama, and poetry. This copy is in the original boards with a paper label on the spine.
