*Manflight* is a reprint of an article written by James Means (1853-1920) and first published in the Boston Evening Transcript, January 12 and 15, 1884, under the title "The Next Great Invention." Means was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and worked as a shoe manufacturer before turning his attention to aeronautics in the 1880s. Like many before him, his interest in aeronautics was influenced by studying the flight of birds. While aboard a steamship bound from Panama to San Francisco, he observed the flight of gulls, though he was unable to solve the problem of flight during the voyage. Still, he came to the conclusion that sustained flight "depends not so much upon the existence of a vast amount of power, or comparitive lightness of the body sustained, as upon a correct application of that power." It was not until some time later that, while reading a publication "of some English aeronautical society" (quite possibly an *Annual Report of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain*), his interest in aeronautics was renewed.

*Manflight* is Means' attempt at coming up with a viable design for heavier-than-air flight. He lists five classes of machines, including bouyant vessels, winged machines, screw machines, aero-plane machines (using the aero-plane in combination with one or elements of the previous classes), and combination machines (using elements from two or more of the previous classes). He then provides the faults or challenges for each class. The interesting thing here is that Means argues against "passive surfaces" or non-oscillating wings for aero-plane machines because "the introduction of a passive surface into a machine whose action is continuous would be useless, because it could only derive power by detracting from that of the continuously acting surface at the expense of the latter." Means' solution is based on the operation of ships. A screw creates enough thrust to allow ships to move through the water. This same principle can be applied for motion through the air. Means mentions that James Bell Pettigrew, author of *Animal Locomotion*, is the closest to coming up with a viable solution involving screws given his previous studies on the topic.

The second part of the book consists of some commentary on the original paper found in the first part. Means describes a potential path forward using a light-weight engine that was described by Samuel Langley in an article in "Century" magazine. Means still argues against aero-planes and thinks the solution to heavier-than-air flight involves using some sort of screw mechanism to generate lift and propulsion. Included is a diagram, slightly modified from part I of this book, of a design created by Means. The flying machine is driven by a screw or system of screws and wide rudders to control the rotation of the car. A third rudder placed at right angle of the other two would be used to move the machine along the horizontal plane. The hope is that these rudders can be arranged in such a way that they can slow down the machine during a descent so that it can "come to earth like a feather."

This pamphlet was printed for Means by Rockwell and Church in Boston. This particular copy comes from the aeronautical collection of Bill Rhode, a WWII Army tail-gunner, stunt pilot, and aviation historian who lived in Wayne, New Jersey. It is in the original blue wrappers.
