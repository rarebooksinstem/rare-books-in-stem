Between the publication of *Manflight* in 1891 and *The Problem of Manflight* in 1894, there was good progress in the field of mechanical flight and gliding experiments. There was also, as Means points out in the first paragraph of this work, an increased interest in aeronautics. There were two camps of people when it came to their approach to heavier-than-air flight. The first camp consisted of people like Hiram Maxim (1840-1916), who were proponents of machines that carried motors and were thus self-propelling. The second camp consisted of people like Arthur Mellen Wellington (1847-1895), who believed that wind power was sufficient and that a motor was not needed for sustained flight; the problem of artificial flight was thus reduced to finding a way to acquire that initial velocity and generate lift. Even in the 1890s, there were discussions about the feasibility of using motors given their weight. Octave Chanute noted in "Progress in Flying Machines" that a few experiments that used the wind for power "accomplished remarkable results."

Before giving his own observations on bird flight, Means first quotes several passages from *The Reign of Law* by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll. Campbell was very much interested in aeronautics, and the inaugural meeting of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain on January 12, 1866, was held at his residence at Campden Hill. Means extends Campbell's observations using the figure below. The wind is shown to be blowing westward. At point A, the bird inclines its wings so that the wind hits them in a such a way that it generates lift. At point B, the bird glides down to a lower point in a zigzag pattern (known as tacking) to make progress against a headwind. This manoeuver is repeated as necessary.

Figure 2 below shows Means' idea for transporting freight by sliding it down long inclines using aeroplanes. This idea is important in understanding how Means and others thought about sustained flight. To travel long distances in the air, it was first necessary to hoist the aeroplane by a balloon to a sufficient height and then minimize the angle of descent to allow the aeroplane to travel as far as possible. Means estimates that an altitude of 1000 to 1200 feet would be sufficient for a soaring machine to travel 18 to 20 miles.

Means conducted a series of experiments between late 1893 and early 1894. Several soaring machines were launched from the balcony of the Boston Light and the cliffs at Manomet. Two of the three experiments from the Boston Light ended in failure because of the wind. The third "righted itself before reaching the ground." The experiments at Manomet were even less successful because the machines never gained enough velocity to clear the cliff. For anyone wanting to conduct experiments, especially with a machine as large as Otto Lilienthal's, Means suggests using the summit of Mt. Willard near Crawford House in New Hampshire. (Crawford House was a hotel in Crawford Notch that closed in 1975 and eventually burned down in November of 1977.)

Figure 3 below shows Means' design for a soaring machine. The backbone of the machine, depicted by A, is a thin piece of pine wood that is four feet long. Some of the other dimensions are given in the figure. Some rods made of steel wire act as pendulums and are used for stability and control. From figure 2 above, the intent of this machine is to "gain velocity by a swoop, and then automatically steer itself into a horizontal or very slightly descending course." Optionally, the machine can be outfitted with a rudder that helps keep it afloat if experiments are conducted near water.

Means ends this work by proposing that experiments be encouraged in order to generate interest in this problem and develop a solution before the end of the century. He suggests a prize to the constructor of "the most successful soaring-machine," to be given after a public trial is held early in September of 1894. He offers $100 of his own money if others can come up with the other $900. It is unclear if this prize was ever awarded.

This copy has the original pictorial wrappers, which are chipped, as seems to be the case with most copies. The illustration on the cover of this work shows Lilienthal during one of his gliding experiments, the results of which were published in the *Berlin Illustrirte Zeitung* of October 7, 1893. All of the drawings found in that article were made from instantaneous photographs.
