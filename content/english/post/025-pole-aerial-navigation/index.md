William Pole was one of the "ablest scientists and engineers of England" during his lifetime (*The Railway Review*, November 18, 1882). Though more known for his contributions in other areas of engineer, he did publish a couple papers on aerial navigation. The first is an 1881 paper titled "Aerial Navigation," found in volume XXIX of *The Fortnightly Review*. The next two papers are part of the *Minutes of Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers*, which was printed in London. This paper, "A Study of the Problem of Aerial Navigation," can be found in volume LXVII from 1881. The second paper can be found in volume LXXXI from 1884.

Even in the 1880s, those who dedicated their lives to studying the problem of aerial navigation were met with ridicule. However, Pole points out that there is "nothing unreasonable or inconsistent with mechanical principles in the idea." It is very similar to the problem of navigation through water. This paper is broken up into three sections: what has been done, what may be done, and some practical considerations. 

In the first section, the first pioneer of aerial navigation mentioned is Antoine Lavoisier, a chemist and physicist who stated that "by reaction against the air, an independent motion might be given to the balloon, and might be made use of to modify the direction impressed upon it by the wind." The Montgolfier brothers and other early aeronauts conducted experiments to test this idea, including attaching oars to balloons. However, none of these experiments were successful. In the 1850s, the French engineer Henri Jacquest Giffard used steam to power a screw propeller attached to an elongated balloon with a diameter of 12 meters and a length of 44 meters. This allowed him to navigate through the air with an independent velocity of two to three meters per second. The figure below shows the dirigible constructed by Giffard. Enrique Dupuy de L&#244;me conducted a similar experiment, though, instead of steam, four men were employed to turn a screw propeller of two sails. This allowed the balloon to travel about three meters per second through the air. Details of de L&#244;me's work can be found in volumes LXII and LXXIV of *Comptes Rendus*.

In the next section, Pole discusses the construction of an elongated balloon and considers pratical matters such as the weight of the balloon and necessary cargo, ascending power, useful power, air resistance, and efficiency of the propeller. The resistance of the balloon as it moves through the air is noted as being the "most important element of the whole investigation" and also the most difficult given the scarcity of experimental data. Pole uses the resistance of ships through the water to estimate this value, which is given as a function of the square of the maximum diameter of the balloon and the square of the velocity. For the power source, he says that steam is better than using people given that the equipment for steam power is lighter, though steam engines at that time were still too heavy to be of any practical use given the limited carrying capacity. There was one invention that helped with this problem. An air-condenser could be used to cool the steam and retrieve some of the original water.

The final section on practical considerations includes a disussion on several topics that plagued the aeronautics community during the 19th century. The first was the matter of construction and stability of the balloon. The shape would probably need to be elongated to maximize the success of aerial navigation. The second topic was on the actual flight of a balloon. The design of the propeller, its size, and where it was placed were all important factors to consider. Pole ends the paper with optimism, saying that "such a system would have peculiar advantages of its own; and on the whole, dirigible balloons may form a feasible and useful addition to the present means of transport, and are therefore worthy the attention of the engineer."

Some information about Pole's life is given here. Much of it is taken from his obituary found in volume 143 of the *Minutes of Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers*. Pole was born in Birmingham on April 22, 1814. Between the ages of fifteen and about twenty, he worked as an apprentice to Charles Henry Capper at the Horseley Company and then moved to London in 1836, where he worked in gasworks, heating and ventilation, and pumping engines. In 1844, he became the first Professor of Engineering at Elphinstone College in Mumbai. He stayed in India until 1847, after he was told "his health would no longer stand the climate of India." He resumed work in London in 1848. Pole was noted for his mathematical ability and the application of higher mathematics to engineering problem. Thus, he was employed to investigate bridges, using armor for warships and fortifications, mountain railways, and the supply of water in London. It is noted that, despite his busy professional life, he made time for other pursuits, which included literature, music, astronomy, modern languages (French, German, Italian, and Spanish), physiology, the study of jewels, and the study of color blindness. For his elaborate research into color blindness, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1861.

His interest in aeronautics, then, was perhaps a natural consequence of his interest in these other areas. His own words perhaps sum up his life best: "My work has been earnest and I hope on the whole creditable and useful. I have had no ambition for special distinction. In everything I have done I have been only one of the working multitude, and the modest objects of my exertions have been reasonably attained." He died on December 30, 1900, almost exactly three years before the Wright Brothers' famous flight near Kitty Hawk.
