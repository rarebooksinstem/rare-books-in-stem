In this issue of *Scientific American*, a writer by the name of W. D. G. wrote an article titled "A Flying Machine," in which he describes his idea for a practical flying machine. Much of the article is given below. Several issues of *Scientific American* during the last 20th century include questions by a W. D. G. in the "Notes and Queries" section, and it is possible that the author of this article is the same person. The full name and identity of W. D. G. are unknown, however.

The article begins with a plea to the community to continue studying the problem of building a practical flying machine. A "fireless steam engine" is assumed to provide the power, and the intent of this article is to "show a good arragement for the other parts."

"The horizontal driving shaft passes through the frame of the car, and is made to revolve by means of its [cranks], worked by rods from the oscillating cylinders below. At each end of this shaft are beveled gears which actuate the vertical wing shafts, and so rotate the spiral fans.

"The arms which support the wing spindles are disconnected at the center of the car (under the canopy) and so arranged upon the car frame that, by means of handles, they are easily and quickly made to revolve, partially and indenpendently above the shaft, so that the gearing may always be in action. The object is to incline the wing shafts, for the purposes of propelling the machine forward or backward, or of turning it around when desired.

"By this mode of gearing, the two fan wings always revolve in contrary directions to each other, and each has the same number of revolutions. They are also of the same form and size. When both wing shafts are vertical, the car moves upward; when both are slightly inclined in one and the same direction, the car will not only rise, but also move forward; and a contrary inclination of both wings stops the forward motion. A certain velocity of the wings, when the shafts are vertical or nearly so, as before said, causes the car to rise; a less velocity balances it in the air, neither rising nor falling, and still less allows it to descend gently.

"The form of the car can be varied to suit the fancy, and it can be made to carry two or more persons. The legs are supposed to be hinged to the body, and to have stout india rubber straps attached across them, to act like springs, breaking the jar when the machine alights. Should the car wings cease to revolve, they will act, with the canopy of the car, as parachutes to break the fall. Indeed, a regular parachute can be made to rise and open above the canopy, and flaps may be placed on the sides of the car, if desired.

"The most effective inclination or angle for the blades appears to be about 33&#176; from a horizontal line. The wings need not be very large. When intended to carry the machine and only one man, ten feet diameter for each wing appears to be quite sufficient.

"We must not mistake the bouyant power of still air for its capabilities under the quick stroke of a wing. This effect of rapid motion in the wing is well illustrated in birds. A wild duck of quick motion flies with only one square inch of wing to each ounce of its weight; a turkey with only three fourths, robins with four, tame pigeons with three and three quarters, bats twenty, and butterflies from twenty to fifty; and we find generally that large and heavy birds have much less wing space, proportionally, than the smaller ones."

W. D. G. ends by claiming the flying machine can be built to weigh only 150 lbs. (assuming a fairly lightweight motor is used) and at a cost of a "good horse." An image of the proposed flying machine is shown below.
