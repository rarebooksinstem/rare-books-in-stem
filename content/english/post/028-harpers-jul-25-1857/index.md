This is a great two-page article on the history of flying machines, both lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air. A brief summary of the contents is provided here. The first example of a flying man this article gives is of someone in Rome who was able to "ascend high in the air" during the reign of Emperor Nero, though "by what means we are not informed." He ended up falling and breaking his neck. In the 13th century, Friar Roger Bacon suggested constructing a large and hollow globe of copper and filling it with "ethereal air or liquid fire." He did not provide any details on how to construct such a globe, nor did he specify how to make the liquid fire.

During the 16th century, there are some reports of flight attempts throughout Europe. "A monk in Spain took to himself wings, and flew from a tower about the space of a furlong. Busbequius tells us of a Turk of Constantinople who could fly. A Venetian flew from the top of St. Mark's steeple. Another, a Nurembergian, makde wings, and flew, but fell and broke his legs." During the 15th and 16th centuries, it was believed that the atmosphere extended only a short distance above the surface of the earth. Beyond that was some sort of "bouyant ether" on which flying machines or other weighted bodies could be supported.

In the 17th century, Francesco Lana de Terzi proposed a balloon with four very thin and hollow spheres that were exhausted of air, thus allowing it to float through the air. A description of this machine can be found in his *Prodromo*, printed in 1670. However, the plan was not sound given that the thin spheres would not be able to withstand the external pressure of the atmosphere.
