This is a great two-page article on the history of flying machines, mainly focusing on balloons. A brief summary of the contents is provided here, along with some relevant comments in parentheses. The first example of a flying man this article gives is of someone in Rome who was able to "ascend high in the air" during the reign of Emperor Nero, though "by what means we are not informed." He ended up falling and breaking his neck. (This is most likely referring to Simon Magnus.) In the 13th century, Friar Roger Bacon suggested constructing a large and hollow globe of copper and filling it with "ethereal air or liquid fire." He did not provide any details on how to construct such a globe, nor did he specify how to make the liquid fire.

During the 16th century, there were some noteworthy reports of flight attempts throughout Europe. "A monk in Spain took to himself wings, and flew from a tower about the space of a furlong. Busbequius tells us of a Turk of Constantinople who could fly. A Venetian flew from the top of St. Mark's steeple. Another, a Nurembergian, made wings, and flew, but fell and broke his legs." During the 15th and 16th centuries, it was believed that the atmosphere extended only a short distance above the surface of the earth. Beyond that was some sort of "bouyant ether" on which flying machines or other weighted bodies could be supported.

In the 17th century, Francesco Lana de Terzi proposed a balloon with four very thin and hollow spheres that were exhausted of air, thus allowing it to float through the air. (A description of this machine can be found in his *Prodromo*, printed in 1670.) However, the plan was not sound given that the thin spheres would not be able to withstand the external pressure of the atmosphere.

In 1678, a locksmith in Sabl&#233;, France, by the name of Besnier built a mechanism consisting of "wing-like paddles, by aid of which he was enabled to fly short distances, and even to cross rivers." The image below shows the machine. The ends of two poles were fitted with small wings, and the poles were attached to the person's shoulders. The front wings were moved using the person's hands and the rear wings using his feet. The exact nature of Besnier's success is unknown. (It is possible that he was able to slow his descent while jumping off a hill but impossible that he was able to actually ascend using this machine.)

In 1709, Bartholomew Laurent (actual name Bartholomew Louren&#231;o de Gusm&#227;o) claimed to have invented a flying machine and was	given a professorship of mathematics at the University of Coimbra. An image of his flying machine is given below. A sail was spread over the body of the machine, and the wind was to be projected into the sail through several small tubes. If there was no wind, he suggested using bellows. Flight experiments with this machine were never conducted.

Two famous pioneers of ballooning are Joseph-Michel and Jacques-&#201;tienne Montgolfier. In November of 1782, they filled a sack made of light material with air heated by burning paper. The article states that the sack had a capacity of 548 cubic feet and rose to a height of 800 feet before descending and landing on a neighboring hill. Their success encouraged them to experiment further. Next, a balloon of line was made, weighing 450 pounds. It made its ascent on June 5, 1783, in the town of Annonay, France. The illustration below shows this first Montgolfier balloon. Using a stove and alcohol as the heating substance made the Montgolfier balloons safer because there was a lower risk of the balloon catching fire. Some of the first living things sent up in balloons included a sheep, a cock, and a duck.

Seeing the success of the Montgolfier balloons, Jean-Fran&#231;ois Pilatre de Rozier volunteered to ascend with a balloon secured to the ground by long ropes. Given his success, he next wanted to go up without the help of ropes. The Montgolfiers refused on the grounds that it was too dangerous. The King offered to used two prisoners already condemned to death to make the ascent, but de Rozier pushed back and said that "a criminal ought not to have the honor of making the first aerial ascent." On November 21, 21, 1783, de Rozier, along with the Marquis Fran&#231;ois Laurent D'Arlandes, ascended to a height of 3000 feet without any ropes. The balloon caught fire several times but made a safe descent. Among the witnesses of this ascent was Benjamin Franklin.

During the same year, the brothers Anne-Jean Roberts and Nicholas-Louis Roberts constructed the first hydrogen-filled balloon that was filled with gas provided by Professor Jacques Charles. On August 27 (the article incorrectly lists the date as April 27), the balloon was sent up from the Champ-de-Mars and landed near the town of Gonnesse, ten miles northeast of Paris. "The inhabitants hereabout had never heard of a balloon, and when they first caught sight of the descending machine, imagined it to be an evil spirit. The priest of the parish was called out to exorcise the devil; and, armed with crucifix and holy water, and followed by a scant train of the most daring spirits of the town, approached the unwieldy mass, which lay on the ground rolling and tumbling about, as the gas within was agitated. To the command to depart in the name of the Cross and the Virgin the monster paid no heed, and finally, the lookers-on conceived that it must be the moon which had fallen from the heavens. The heaving and tumbling continuing, one of the bravest of the farmers, committing his soul to the Virgin, advanced, pitchfork in hand, and gave the monster a violent stab, which caused the gas to rush out with a sharp noise, and the balloon to collapse. Hereupon the crowd took courage, and assailed it with sticks, stones, swords, and guns, till the innocent linen was rent into a thousand pieces."

By the beginning of the 19th century, balloon ascents had become common, and given the dangers and casualities of ballooning, improvements in safety were necessary. One of the best inventions was the parachute, which could help regulate the descent of a balloon. Robert Cocking was the first known person to have died from a parachuting accident.On July 24, 1837 (the article lists the date of ascent as September 27, 1836), Cocking tested his parachute with the help of Charles Green, who piloted the balloon that took Cocking and his parachute into the air. "The machine&mdash;strong and of considerable size&mdash;was suspended by a cord about fifteen feet below the car of the balloon. Ten feet below the parachute was its car, in which the adventurous Cocking determined to descend." Despite a warning from Green about the dangers of the descent, Cocking went ahead and cut the rope that had held him to the balloon at an elevation of about 3500 feet. Green reported that he felt a shock and felt himself rising rapidly to an elevation of 7000 feet. The last words he heard from Cocking were, "I am in first-rate spirits, and would not give it up for any thing." For the first few moments, the parachute remained upright but was then caught in a current that caused it to become inverted. Cocking descended from 3500 feet in only a minute and a half, the last sixty feet or so taking only a second. Cocking's body was recovered but in a "lamentably mangled condition."

Jean-Pierre Blanchard also equipped his balloon with a parachute along with some wings to help with aerial navigation. The wings proved to be useless, however. An image of Blanchard's modified balloon is shown below.

Now that the principle behind ballooning was well-understood, many aeronauts began studying the problem of controlling the motion of the balloon in the air. Pierre Testu-Brissy constructed a balloon in 1790 with paddle-wheels, as shown below. They proved of little use, so he abandoned the idea. It shall be noted that Testu-Brissy was the first aeronaut to make an ascent on horseback. Another attempt at navigating through the air was made by the Acad&#233;mie de Dijon. The body of the balloon was fitted with sails that could be worked via cranks in the car, but the wind proved too strong for the sails.

The article claims that Jakob Degen, a watchmaker from Vienna, had some success in 1808. His machine consisted of wings that could be folded and unfolded using his hands and feet. "He succeeded in raising himself from the earth and floating along horizontally for some distance. But it was found that the exertion of the body was too severe to make an extended and sustained flight possible."

There were many remarkable and outlandish concepts for flying machines, and one such idea came from Ernest Petin. His idea was to tie together four balloons, "each ninety feet in circumference, by a vast frame 450 feet long and 195 feet broad." The center of this machine would contain some parachutes to help with stability. The machine could be steered using rigged sails, and this made it possible, Petin hoped, to chart a course "even parallel with the direction of the prevailing wind." The article states that Petin has secured funds from investors but, as of the publication of the article, had not yet found a way to make his idea practical.

The article ends with some recent developments in ballooning. John Wise of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, published in 1843 a series of papers outlining his plan to cross the Atlantic during the summer of 1844 in a balloon 100 feet in diameter. As of the date of the article, Wise still had not carried out this experiment, most likely because of insufficient funding. Charles George Green, son of the aeronaut famous Charles Green, was said to be developing a plan for exploring the interior of Australia using a balloon powered by an aerial screw propeller invented by a Mr. Taylor. Finally, Viscount Carlingford of Ireland (Godwin Meade Pratt Swift) patented an aerial machine in 1857 that was claimed to be able to move in any direction through the air. A test flight was scheduled to take place from the Crystal Palace at Sydenham. A description of the machine in the inventor's own words is given below.

"The aerial chariot in form is something in the shape of a boat, extremely light, with one wheel in front and two behind, having two wings slightly concave fixed to its sides, and sustained by laths communicating their pressure through the body of the chariot from one wing to the other, and supported by cords whose force, acting on two hoops nearly of an oval shape, holds the wings firmly in their position, using a force that can not be less than ten tons, on the principle of corded musical instruments. The aerial chariot is provided with a tail that can be raised or lowered at pleasure, and which serves for giving an elevating or declining position, and worked by a cord that communicates into the interior of the chariot, which is drawn forward by an aerial screw of the perfect form of the screw propeller, and which screws into the air at an elevation of forty-five degrees, similar to the bird's wing, and is turned by means of a winch acting on three multiplying wheels."
