Richard Gypson was an English balloonist born in 1811. His career spanned about ten years between 1839 and 1849 and, except for a few incidents, "was not otherwise remarkable" (J. E. Hodgson's *The History of Aeronautics in Great Britain*). His first ascent was made on May 14, 1832. His "Royal Standard" balloon was made "of the 'richest silk' of crimson and gold, and with a circumference of 118 feet it had a capacity of 20,000 cubic feet" (Hodgson). A footnote by Hodgon notes that a poster advertising Gypson's second ascent on May 13, 1839, claims the balloon could be inflated with hydrogen gas and carry eight people, though there is no evidence that hydrogen gas was ever used.

While an experienced aeronaut, Gypson didn't make any technical improvements to ballooning. The special valve he invented to release air quickly didn't seem to have made much of an effect. He did have a couple of close calls during his ascents. One was on July 6, 1847, when the balloon burst six thousand feet in the air. Another passenger, Henry Coxwell, was able to form a parachute by cutting the string that held down the neck of the balloon, thus saving the lives of all four passengers. The second incident was during his 100th ascent in October of 1849, when the neck of the balloon and valve were frozen shut. He had to make a large incision in the envelope to allow some of the air to escape and thus allow the balloon to land safely.

Gypson gave up ballooning in 1849, possibly because of financial reasons, and turned to writing "doggerel poetry" (Hodgson). His last recorded public appearance was in May of 1853, when he was found guilty of stealing some pewter pots, but he was released after an hour because of questions around his sanity.

This advertisement mentions that Charles Green also took part in the ascent on July 22, 1839. Green was a famous English balloonist who completed over 500 ascents between the years of 1821 and 1852, making him one of the most experienced balloonists of the 19th century. Hodgson dedicated an entire chapter discussing Green's life and ballooning achievements (chapter XI).

The Albert Saloon, where the ascent advertised here, was originally known as the Royal Standard Tavern and was managed by Henry Brading from 1843 to 1850. Brading sometimes accompanied the other famous aeronauts who made ascents from the tavern grounds until it closed in 1857. The ascents by Charles Green were noted to be especially popular.
