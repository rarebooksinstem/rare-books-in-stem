This is a scarce and interesting work by George Nathan Chase and Henry William Kirchner. Before getting into the contents of the book, it is worth mentioning that this is a particularly fine copy of this work. It is bound in maroon cloth titled in gilt. It is also signed by Chase on the front free endpaper. There is another signature next to Chase's, presumably belonging to a previous owner. There are nine plates bound in the back, and there are charming little illustrations to be found above or next to the first four chapter titles. The nine plates are shown at very bottom of this page.

The book is broken up into seven chapters. In the first chapter, the authors state that "the limitations of steam are practically reached, and with them those of safety and speed." A new source of power is therefore needed. "It is generally conceded that electricity is the coming motive power, or, at all events, that the days of steam's monopoly are numbered." However, the application of electricity to motive power was very much in its infancy. The chapter ends with an acknowledgement to [Dr. John E. Davies](https://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/4MF5PMIV4I7LB8D), Professor of Mathematical Physics of University of Wisconsin, and Samuel P. Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institute. The authors also call out Langley's *Experiments in Aerodynamics* as being of "great assistance."

The second chapter gives an overview of the current system of railways. In 1830, only 40 miles of railroad were in operation in the United States. By 1892, this had increased to 175,223 miles, which shows the importance of the system during the 19th century. The average cost of railroads, including all equipment, was estimated to be $50,000 per mile in the West and $75,000 per mile in the East. In England and other parts of Europe, this cost was $180,000 per mile. The earliest railroads in the United States were built quickly and cheaply in order to meet the demands of a country that was rapidly growing. The authors predict that, given the advancements toward the latter half of the 19th century, a speed of 60 mph was possible between large cities. To further improve on the railroad system of the time, the authors say that abolishing grades and curves is also necessary, though they acknowledge that is impossible to completely attain this.

The third chapter presents a very short discussion on aerial navigation. The authors state that "experiment has long since demonstrated the fact that it is possible to construct a vehicle possessing the ability to rise in the air, carrying a considerable load and capable of being propelled." The two obstacles standing in the way of a successful flying machine are the inability to control the machine and the failure to provide enough energy to propel it for any considerable distance. The chapter ends with the following: "Flight is not a function of levity, but of weight and power. Man, if he ever fly, must closely imitate the flight of birds."

The fourth chapter presents in introduction to the aerodromic system. In their own words, "the problem which the inventors have undertaken to solve is the construction of a machine, which will be able to run upon the air at great speed, guided by a track in absolute safety, and supplied with power by a means now available." This application of the principle of flight to railroads was a novel idea and protected by a patent. The benefit of this approach was that it eliminated some of the obstacles to great speed from railways, that is, grades and lateral curves, and the problems assocated with aerial navigation, that is, starting, stopping, and guiding. The authors then quote several passages from Langley's work between 1887 and 1890 on aerodynamics and mechanical flight. The take-away from Langley's research was that "mechanical flight is possible with the engines we now possess" (see Langley's *Experiments in Aerodynamics*).

The fifth chapter contains details about the new system. "The track is elevated and of steel. It consists of two parallel trusses, 6 ft. in depth, and about 11 ft. apart. The upper and lower chords of these trusses form the rails or guides. This trussed roadway is supported upon steel columns, a variation in the height of which, helps to modify the grade where necessary. These columns are firmly fastened to stone or concrete foundations, and are thoroughly braced. The spans average about 37 ft. in length, but may be varied to suit the requirements of the terrain. They are tied from the underside to prevent spreading, and are made absolutely rigid. The rails are of especial designs. The lower ones are reversed, and so constructed as to give a bearing for wheels on their lower sides. The trusses are fastened to the columns, as shown [in the illustrations]."

The track needs to be practically a straight line between stations, with some curves in the immediate vicinity of the stations to help with deceleration. The cars are between 40 and 100 ft. long and contain the "usual interior arrangements for comfort." The cars need to be closed and made of a shape that reduces air resistance. The top of each car is fitted with sets of aeroplanes, the surface areas of which vary between 2,000 and 4,000 sq. ft. depending on load. The planes are hinged at their rear edge to vary their angle and are controlled by an operator to increase or decrease the lift or drag as needed. This machine is powered by an electrical supply. A circuit of 5,000 to 10,000 volts, converted to 500 volts for the motor, delivers power. 

The last couple chapters deal with practical considerations, such as cost, safety, and studies on drag. The appendix contains several tables, including air resistance as a function of speed and drift on an inclined plane. According to Thomas Edison, electrical locomotion could propel a machine at up to 150 mph. The authors therefore suggest that a speed of 125 mph for their machine is reasonable. This would allow someone to travel between New York and San Francisco in 24 hours.

Contemporary reviews of this work appear to be mixed. In volume 4 of the *Street Railway Review*, the author of the review writes, "As a curiosity, its suggestions are interesting, but as possessing any practical merit, it would seem that the air ship minus the air and propelled simply by electricity will always be better." The November 2, 1894, issue of *The Railroad Gazette* contains a review of the book and says only that "We shall but follow the authors further, but the reader can understand that this great idea has many ramifications." Funnily enough, the review begins by stating that this pamphlet initially came into their hands some months prior but "unfortunately fell into the waste basket." The May 5, 1894, issue of *Scientific American* contains a brief summary on the work. The article is titled "The Chase-Kirchner Aerodromic Railroad," though the actual title of the book is not mentioned anywhere in the review. The April 19, 1894, issue of *Engineering News* states that "there are a number of details outlined in this pamphlet which seem to us dubious or mistaken, but the step first proposed at least is a good one." The July 7, 1894, issue of *Electrical World* contains a criticism about how this vehicle can maintain traction when the planes lift the cars, but it is noted that the pamphlet is interesting for its statistical railroad data and atmospheric resistance tables. A short line between Philadelphia and New York was to be constructed to test this new idea, but there is no indication that anyone ever attempted to build either this line or this machine.

Henry W. Kirchner lived in Denver (Arapahoe County) until at least late August, 1893, and then moved to Missouri. A description of his many patents and work can be found in several engineering and railroad magazines of the 1890s. George N. Chase was born in Wisconsin on July 31, 1853. He graduated from West Point in June of 1877 and was eventually made First Lieutenant in the Army. He retired from active duty on February 20, 1891, because of a disability during the line of duty. He died March 19, 1916, in Los Angeles.
