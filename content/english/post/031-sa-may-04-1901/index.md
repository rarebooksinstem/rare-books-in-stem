This article describes a model built by Josef Hofmann (note that his name is spelled "Hofman" in the original article), a government councilor from Berlin. Unlike many aviators and inventors of the time, Hofmann began by building a 1:10 scale model. Two of the greatest challenges of operating a flying machine were taking off and landing. Samuel P. Langley, for example, developed a catapult to help his flying machine take off. Hofmann's approach was different from others of his time in that he used legs attached to wheels that were "drawn from the ground close to the body when the propellers are set in motion." The wings were sufficient to provide the lift necessary to allow the machine to fly higher, and the propellers could be used to maintain the desired altitude. The propellers were driven by a steam engine that was supplied with steam at a pressure of 165 pounds by a boiler composed of 72 water tubes. The engine was made of steel, but Hofmann intended to use coal or even petroleum as fuel for a full-sized flying machine. 

There are three figures that accompany this article, and they are shown below.

According to a very short obituary found in *Zeitschrift f&#252;r Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt*, Hofmann died at the age of 73 in 1923 in W&#252;rzburg-Zell. The obituary notes that he was a well-known aviation engineer. He demonstrated steam-powered, free-flying kite models in Berlin and lived for a time in Geneva. After 1910, he was known only as a writer. In 1911, he published a book titled *Der Maschinenflug*, which discusses flight in nature along with mankind's attempts at building flying machines.
