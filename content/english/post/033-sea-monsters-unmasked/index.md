*Sea Monsters Unmasked* by Henry Lee is one of the one-shilling handbooks that was printed at the International Fisheries Exhibition in 1883. The handbooks were published by William Clowes and Sons, Limited, of 13 Charing Cross, S. W. The exhibition was held in South Kensington, London, between May 12 and October 31. However, two sources indicate an end date of November 1, 1883 (*Descriptive Catalogues of the Collections Sent from the United States to the International Fisheries Exhibition, London, 1883* and *Appletons' Annual Cyclopaedia and Register of Important Events of the Year 1883*). It is possible that the fair ended a day earlier than anticipated.

This book takes a scientific approach to this topic and is divided into two parts. The first part is on the kraken and goes into detail about historical sightings of giant specimens that were said to have large tentacles and beaks. Lee argues that the majority of the sightings can be attributed to octopuses and squid, many species of which inhabit the North Atlantic Ocean, where many sightings take place. Lee also presents an overview of the biology of octopuses, squid (calamary), and cuttlefish. An interesting note is that, starting in about 1870, there were many cases where dead specimens or parts of specimens were preserved and sent to several museums across Europe. One of the larger fragments came from an attack on two fishermen. One of the men was able to chop off "both arms with an axe as they lay on the gunwale of the boat." One of the fragments that was cut measured 17 feet in length and 3.5 feet in circumference. There were also reports of entire species being captured that measure more than fifty feet and even up to eighty feet.

The second part of the book is on sea serpent sightings. Again, Lee presents some historical sightings and says that some of these sightings can be attributed to things like many porpoises swimming together in a large group. Other times, the sightings were probably exaggerated, perhaps not intentionally but because the seafaring population was uneducated about the habits and affinities of some of the more unusual species found in the ocean. It is also possible that discarded gear and debris account caught on whales, turtles, and fish accounted for many cases of mistaken identity.

That being said, Lee is unable to explain all of the sightings and leaves open the very real possibility that there are still undiscovered species of gigantic size in the depths of the ocean, "even a creature having close affinities with the old sea-reptiles whose fossil skeletons tell of their magnitude and abundance in past ages." He ends the paper by saying that anyone who witnesses a supposed appearance of a sea monster should faithfully note it down without fear of ridicule or disbelief.

This book contains twenty-six illustrations, including the frontispiece. Many of them correspond to actual sightings. A handful of them are shown below.
