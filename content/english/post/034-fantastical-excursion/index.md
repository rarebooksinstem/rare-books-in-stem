This scarce work written by an anonymous author begins with remarks on the vastness and beauty of space, with its myriad of stars and planets. It is the hope of the narrator that one day people can "be enabled by means of balloons to make excursions in the fields of air; dreaming, perhaps, of future possibilities of giving a friendly call, if not at the planets, yet, at least, at our satellite, the moon." Unlike many works of speculative fiction during this time, which used some type of spacecraft for space exploration, *A Fantastical Excursion into the Planets* takes a different approach. The narrator visits various planets and the moon with the help of a sprite with "an enormous pair of beautiful wings" called Imagination. The actual act of flying is described as follows: "It was not positively a flying, but rather a wafting proceeding, and that with so much speed, that I could not take the least notice of my tract, having lost all my senses; nor is it even yet clear whether I really have recovered them, the relation of my excursion will be the test of that."

The narrator visits Mercury, Venus, the moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus and describes the inhabitants and scenery of each planet in great detail. Some of the descriptions are based on scientific knowledge that the average educated person at the time would have known, but the majority is based purely on fanciful imagination. The writing can only be described as purple prose and flowery. As Robert Crossley notes in *Imagining Mars: A Literary History*, the author of *A Fantastical Excursion into the Planets* "was no unsung rural Milton." Crossley adds, "There is so feeble a sense for style in the narration, such a stunning lack of authorial tact that it is no wonder that the book has long been forgotten." Despite its flaws, it is nevertheless an interesting book and worthy of attention. An old bookseller's catalog by James Coleman contains just one note about this book, which is that it is "very curious."

This particular copy is a presentation copy, most likely given to Caroline Wyndham-Quin ("Viscountess Adare"), wife of Windham Henry Quin, 2<sup>nd</sup> Earl of Dunraven of Adare Manor. Interestly enough, it is very possible that the she never read the book given how many of the pages remain unopened. If she or any of the previous owners of this copy did read the book, it was most certainly done using another copy. I have decided to keep this copy in the same condition as when I bought it and used a digital copy for reference.

A single page of the publisher's advertisements can be found tipped onto the front free endpaper. Saunders and Otley was a partnership between Simon Saunders and Edward John Otley. The firm was in business from 1824 to 1871. They were one of the leading publishers in London in the 1830s, but by the 1840s, they became a "second-rank publisher" (John Sutherland's *The Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction*).
