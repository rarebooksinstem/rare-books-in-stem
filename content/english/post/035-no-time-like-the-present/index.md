Mary Elliott's (1794 - 1870) *No Time Like the Present* is an early example of kite flying being mentioned in Western literature. This copy still has its original wrappers, and there are three illustrations, including a frontispiece, that accompany the text. Older children's books can be hard to find given that many were used heavily and later discarded.

The kite depicted in the frontispiece is a typical English arch top kite, which was popular in the 19th century. George Cayley's experiments involved a kite that had a very similar shape, with curved edges at the top. Another interesting thing to note is that the kite is decorated with an image of a hot air balloon. Ballooning gained popularity in England in the 1780s and 1790s, with several famous ascents taking place throughout England during this time. This book was printed around the time when one the most well-known balloonists, Charles Green, was making ascents.

In this book, the kite serves as a distraction for the main character, Richard. The kite is given to him by his uncle, and when he asks his friend George to play with him, George refuses because he wants to focus on his spelling lesson. Later, while tasked with delivering an important letter, Richard runs into several children who are also flying a kite and want him to join them. He agrees to play with them (his smaller kite ends up flying higher than the larger kite one of the other boys has) and ends up failing to deliver the letter in time. The story does end on a postive note, however.

This copy contains one signature on the verso of the wrapper. It reads Esther Maria Jowitt, who was presumably signing the book to indicate ownership. Based on genealogy records, she was born on April 8, 1825, in Leeds, Yorkshire, and died on September 7, 1889. She never married. It is unclear when she acquired this copy and what year she signed it, though given the intended audience of the book, it is very possible she was no more than ten.

The 1825 printing is the first edition of this work. By this time, Elliott was a popular writer of children's books. This book was reprinted several times until the 1840s and was even printed in America and France. It was first printed in America by Samuel Wood & Sons, likely in the late 1820s. Henry Benton of Hartford, Connecticut, printed this book twice, in 1839 and in 1843.

Elliott's early books were published under her maiden name, Mary Belson. Her first book, *The Mice and their Pic Nic*, was published in 1809, and this began her illustrious career as a writer of children's books. The majority of her books were printed by the Darton family, who were known for printing children's books during the late-18th and early-19th centuries. The printer of this book, William Darton II, set up shop in Holborn Hill in 1804 as an independent bookseller and publisher after an apprenticeship with his father. He was joined by his brother Thomas a couple years later and then by his son, John Maw Darton, in 1830.

The back cover of this book contains a list of other children's books published by William Darton.
