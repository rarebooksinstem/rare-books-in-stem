"A Flying Parachute" is a short article about a flying model created by someone from California. The name of the author is not given. Instead, there is a note from the editors at the end saying they did not attempt to construct this model and instead leave it as an exercise for the younger readers of the magazine. The full text of the article is given below.

<p><h6>There are many instances in veritable history where a scientific toy has developed into a valuable aid to mechanical progress. A correspondent from California sends us a communication in which he advances the same idea, illustrated by sketches which we reproduce. He says: "Having followed the sea a number of years, I have noted with much interest, the progress of sea birds through the air, and wondered whether man had not as good a right in the aerial kingdom of birds, who seem to possess it alone. As the subject of aerial traveling seems to have aroused some attention in Europe I have made bold to give my idea of a contrivance for supporting a weight in the atmosphere. Try this experiment; get three small sticks half the size of a penholder and about eighteen inches long; take two of them and tie them crosswise, as at A, then a third one, splitting it at one end and inserting between the open ends, a short stick, as at B. Then tie the whole or unsplitted end to the two crossed pieces, C, to form a frame for the wings and tail. The body and tail with pieces of paper pased on the sticks will make the artificial bird, D.</p></h6>

<p><h6>Now take a weight of three or four ounces and suspend it, as shown at E, and your flyer is complete. Two of the strings should be attached to the wings, each about six inches from the intersection of the wing sticks with the body or straight stick; the other two to be attached to the straight or horizontal stick. Try the apparatus in a room until you have the right relation between the weight and the bird; then send it out of an upper window."</p></h6>
