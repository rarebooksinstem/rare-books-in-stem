This article was originally published in 1889 under the title "Oiseaux M&#233;caniques" in the French magazine *La Nature*, which was founded by aviation pioneer Gaston Tissandier. It features a short description of a small model developed by a Mr. Pichancourt. It is reproduced in its entirety below.

<p><h6>A very skillful manufacturer, Mr. Pichancourt, has recently brought out some small mechanical birds which operate very regularly, and one of which we represent herewith. The motion of the wings is brought about by the energy stored up in twisted rubber bands.</p></h6>

<p><h6>In the foreground of our figure are shown the details of the mechanism. In the upper part of the figure the bird is represented on a smaller scale with its wings depressed.</p></h6>

<p><h6>The spread of the wings of this bird is 13 inches. The rubber spring weighs 120 grains and is 5 inches in length. The total weight of the whole is &#190; of an ounce.</p></h6>

<p><h6>The device, in flying, rises slightly and is capable of moving to a distance of 60 feet. Mr. Pichancourt has succeeded in constructing a mechanical bird, of the same kind, of larger size, and which weighs no less than 20 ounces.</p></h6>

<p><h6>Set free by the hand, this apparatus has risen to a height of 25 feet above the ground and fallen at a distance of 21 yards from the starting point, against a head wind of 13 feet per second.</p></h6>

<p><h6>Small mechanical birds of this kind are, of course, but playthings in experimental apparatus; but, when they operate well, as those of Mr. Pichancourt do, they are worthy of being recommended to amateurs of mechanics and aviation. - *La Nature*</p></h6>
