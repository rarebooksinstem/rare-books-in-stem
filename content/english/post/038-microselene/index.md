*Microselene* is an extremely scarce work of fantasy written during a time of great interest in ballooning. The main character of the work is Elisa Garnerin (1791 - 1853), who was an accomplished French balloonist and parachutist. Her first parachute drop was made from the Jardin du Tivoli in September of 1815 in front of the King of Prussia. She made thirty-nine parachute drops between 1815 and 1836 in Italy, Spain, Russia, and Germany (*Lady Icarus: Balloonomania and the Brief, Bold Life of Sophie Blanchard* by Deborah Noyes). An interesting note that is Elisa's aunt Jeanne Garnerin was the first woman to make a parachute jump, which she did in 1799.

The work begins with crowds cheering Garnerin on as she ascends in a balloon. She ascends high enough that the Earth appears like an anthill. At that altitude, she encounters a spirit in a thundercloud. The spirit offers to take her to a smaller moon orbiting the Earth called Microselene. She lands on Microselene using a parachute, and she first encounters a man, Mr. Girasole, walking his poodle (who is described as having descended from a distinguished lineage of dogs) in the morning. He is shocked to see a woman raining from the sky and asks if she lives in the air. She tells him she comes from a another world, which he mistakenly takes to mean that she has returned from the world of the dead. She clarifies that she's from another planet, and he is surprised that she is about the same size as the inhabitants of Microselene because their astronomers had surmised that the inhabitants of Earth are hundred times larger given that Earth is a hundred times larger than Microselene.

This is one example of the type of humor found in the book. In fact, there are numerous jokes, commentaries, and astronomical observations. The setting frequently shifts between Microselene and the house of Mr. Ambrogio, where Garnerin is sharing the story of her trip to a group of people. Mr. Ambrogio, in particular, is excited by this and is shocked that some of the greatest astronomers had failed to discover this second moon. If he just could see it through his telescope, he would be happier than Columbus when he discovered America. Unfortunately, Garnerin is unable to tell him the exact location in the sky as the inhabitants of Microselene are themselves uncertain.

This copy is in its original wrappers and untrimmed. The spine is tattered and the covers barely attached. The internal contents are very good.

Bernard Quaritch published a catalog in August of 2020 called "Summer Miscellany 2020" in which this book was offered for sale. The same copy was offered for sale in their April 2023 New York catalog. This is the description they provide on this book:

"First edition of an innovative early Italian work of satirical imaginative
fiction. Subtitled the 'Curioso viaggio etereo di madamigella Garnerin' [The Curious Voyage of Miss Garnerin], Microselene centres on an aeroporista [aeronaut], and begins with her ascent in a hot air balloon, based on the famous exploits of Elisa Garnerin (1791-1853), the French parachutist and balloonist. As with the novels of Jules Verne several decades later, recent developments in technology provide fuel for speculation; but unlike his strictly circumscribed adventures, the present work revels in diverging fantastically (and comically) from the limitations of scientific possibility. 

"The work begins with Garnerin's ascent in a hot-air balloon, at which point, 'la terra appariva al suo sguardo come un formicaio' [the Earth seeming to her eyes like a vast anthill], she muses on the vanity and pride of humanity. Although this brief commentary is ostensibly interrupted, it strikes a satirical note which continues throughout the work, which finds comedy in the fantastic (and places closer to home) in the manner of Gulliver's Travels. Garnerin meets a sylph (air spirit) riding a cloud being drawn by an eagle and a vulture 'as big as an ox', who offers her the opportunity to visit the Earth's second, lesser-known satellite, the eponymous Microselene.

"The work's self-conscious narrative method regularly digresses to move between characters and locations, and is punctuated by the occasional intrusions of a narrative voice. The narrator addresses the reader on various occasions to excuse the deficiencies in their style, or failure to conform to the tragic or comic mode, concluding with a forceful apology for imaginative fiction and declaring that 'la vita stessa &#232; un continuo vaneggiament' [life itself is a continuous delirium].
