*Aerial Navigation* was written by Charles Blachford Mansfield in 1851 and left in an unfinished state because of his death in 1855. It was published posthumously in 1877 and edited by Mansfield's brother Robert Blochford Mansfield. Even decades after it was originally written, it was an important book because "no publication issued since the author's death has taken the place which this volume was intended to occupy" (*The Westminster Review. Volume CVII. January - April, 1877.*). This is certainly one of the most complete books on the topic of aerial navigation from that time period. It has now become a scarce title, and Mansfield is probably best known today for his work as a chemist. It is noted in the preface, which was written by John Malcolm Ludlow, that Mansfield was a man of many interests; he wrote books on salt, his travels to Paraguay during the summer of 1852, and, of course, aerial navigation.

Despite the length and depth of this work, Mansfield admits his shortcomings on the subject: "I never went up in a balloon, nor ever saw more than half a dozen in my life. I never had any passionate desire to fly, beyond a sonewhat common wish to realise sensations known in dreams, with a notion, till lately only a vague one, that some day or other aerial navigation would be made practicable. I have not made, then, any long study of the question; nor are the following pages the result of laborious years in pursuit of a favorite scheme." This book is divided into two main parts. The first part introduces the problem of aerial navigation and provides some history on the topic. The second part is what Mansfield calls "hints for the solution of the problem." This includes studies on the shape of the aerial vessel, the material it should be made of, how to operate it, and how to power it. The last section discussing power ends abruptly, though some notes left behind by Mansfield offer clues as to how he intended to finish it. The three pages of his brief notes are given below.

The appendices are important because of the bibliography and a discussion on constructing a balloon. The books mentioned in the bibliography show that Mansfield was very well-read on aerial navigation. There are also a number of figures found throughout the book, some of which are shown below.

A second title leaf is shown below and lists the author as Ithi Kefalende, which was a pseudonym used by Mansfield for some of his other works.

The front pastedown bears the signature of H. J. Coningham, a captain in the Leinster Regiment. One obituary states that Coningham was "an authority on the geography of Asia Minor and the Caucasus." Coningham also wrote an article on aviation titled "The Wright Aeroplane," which appeared in the May 19 issue of London's *Daily Mail*. He also wrote an article in *Whitaker's Almanac* for the year 1909. In it, he discusses the future of aerial navigation, especially for military purposes.
