Rudolph Kosch's article, titled "Latest Inventions in Aerial Navigation," provides a brief overview of the people and experiments that influenced his work along with a description of his flying machine. One of his earliest influences was Otto Lilienthal's book *Der Vogelflug als Grundlage der Fliegekunst*, published in 1889. In it, Lilienthal describes experiments conducted starting in 1870 on "different forms of wings, their resistance and lifting efficiency on rotary and flapping apparatus, and also their lifting efficiency when exposed to the wind." Lilienthal concludes that "slightly concave wings with their hollow side turned downward like those of birds, having an arch depth of from one-eighteenth to one-twelfth of their width" give the best results. Kosch used these principles to build his first two machines.

Next, Kosch discusses the findings of Dr. Louis Martin, who was a professor at the University of Kolozsvar in Hungary. Dr. Martin studied the lifting efficiency of continuously flapping or beating wings. In 1893, he introduced a small paddle wheel, "constructed in such a manner that the paddles reach out into the air and strike it with their total surface at the downward rotating half, while they are drawn together near to and along the shaft by an eccentric guide at the upward revolving half of the wheel so as to hardly encounter any resistance whatever from above when being lifted." Dr. Martin guessed that a maximum of 640 kilograms could be kept floating in the air per horsepower. Another experimenter who was a proponent of using flapping wings was Lawrence Hargrave from New South Wales.

According to Kosch, the person who conducted the most valuable experiments was Hiram Maxim&#185;. These experiments are fully described in the October, 1891, and January, 1895, issues of *Century Magazine*. Kosch notes that "Mr. Maxim's flying machine has no equal in aerial navigation from a mechanical standpoint of view, as it comprises the very latest improvements of modern steam engineering, and we find in its construction, as a whole, the best use made of first-class material and workmanship in compliance with the most advanced ideas of structural engineering of the present time." While the runs made with this machine showed that it was possible to build a machine light and powerful enough to lift itself, there was one problem. It had to do with ascension and landing. The only way the machine could ascend into the air was by means of a track that allowed it to reach the necessary initial velocity. Landing the machine was also unsafe because there was no sufficient means of propulsion in the verical direction. Kosch's proposed machine does away with this problem. A description of the machine is given below.

"The apparatus consists mainly of two pairs of wings. Each pair rotates in a horizontal plane, but in different directions when being operated, so that turning the upper pair to the left will cause the lower pair to turn to the right. Both pairs of wings can be flapped down simultaneously while being turned, and then they appear in a combined flapping rotary motion. The wings can also be set in relation to the shaft in such a way that the front edge of each wing, that is the edge which goes ahead in the direction of rotation, is raised to any suitable angle around a pinion of the shaft, so that the two pairs of wings will appear and work like two propeller screws, one right and the other left handed. The blades can be moved up and down while being turned. The motor of this apparatus is operated by a man, who sits in the saddle and turns the crank shaft by means of common bicycle pedals, causing the wings to rotate while they are being flapped up and down by handles, shown higher up on the shaft.

"It will be observed that when the wings are set like screw blades, they will perform a wavelike motion similar to the wing motion of a forward flying bird, the only difference being that the bird's wing travels up and down and forward, while these move up and down and around one center, in both cases the lifting of the wings being accomplished without any loss of power and supporting area by gliding them up on an incline equal to the angle of incidence of the wings. No special effort is necessary to raise the wings directly, because they will resume their horizontal position on account of the screw action due to their inclination and on account of the centrifugal force due to rotation. The flapping action of the wings, which, as stated before, is far superior to any other, is thus applied in such a combination as to fully realize its advantages at the down stroke and to obtain a considerable lifting effect at the up stroke.

"After having reached the desired elevation by the screw and flapping action of the wings, these latter are stopped and set in a horizontal position, and driven forward like aeroplanes, by another pair of propellers of smaller size but higher speed, which, however, are not yet applied to this apparatus.

"There are two bevel gears on the crankshaft engaging those fastened to the lower ends of the two upright shafts from the right and left side respectively, causing the outside tubular shaft to turn right and the other projecting and extending through the first one to turn left. The wings are attached to the hubs of the upper ends of the respective shafts, with a pin allowing each wing to swing up and down around that pin. A spiral spring fastened to the top end of the longer shaft keeps the wings, by means of wire arms, in a horizontal position. Other wires serve for flapping them down, the ends of these being fastened to the hubs of the wings and to the shaft armature respectively, while the handles of the armature are finally held by the operator, who moves them up and down with his hands while turning the pedals by his feet.

"The wings are circular in shape and resemble bicycle wheels in construction. They have, to my knowledge, never been adopted by aviators before. It may be because they are too simple, or too close within reach, that they have been so easily overlooked. Still I think the circle will be the final form of the future aeroplanes and this statement the following simple but important reasons may account for.

"The circle has the largest area inclosed by the smallest circumference among all geometrical forms. To illustrate this, let us compare a circle of an area of 200 square feet, which has a circumference of 50 feet, with a quadrangle 20 feet long and 10 feet wide, the area of which is likewise 200 square feet, having a circumference of 60 feet. This latter being 10 feet longer than the circle, 10 feet more tubing will have to be used to form the outlines of said quadrangle against that of a circle. The actual difference in weight will be much more than that, though, because for bracing	the rim of a wheel only thin steel wires are necessary, as spokes fastened to a short tubular hub in the center, while with a rectangular form probably five times as heavy tubing will have to be employed to stiffen the frame in order to get the same strength and stiffness as with the wheel. One of the wings in Fig. 1 is six feet in diameter, having an area of 2,827 square feet, weighs only five pounds without covering. If Mr. Maxim's aeroplanes would be built on the same principle, the frame work of his 4,000 square feet of sustaining surface would not be more than about 700 or 800 pounds, which is, I am pretty sure, far below the figure of what it actually weighs."

In August of 1895, Kosch completed the machine shown in the figure below. It weighed 56 pounds, and the wings were 6 feet 4 inches in diameter. The wings could be flapped either simultaneously or alternately up and down using two independent handles. This machine was tested with the wings set at various angles, first with two pairs of wings and then with one. Both cases had the same results. Kosch's experiment showed that an angle of 10 degrees was the most favorable, with the lift being 17 pounds without flapping. He concluded that the propellers should be arranged side by side to get the best results. Furthermore, flapping is not necessary, and screw action is sufficient to lift a flying machine.
