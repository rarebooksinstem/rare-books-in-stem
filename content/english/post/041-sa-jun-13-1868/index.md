This short article addressed to the "Disciples of Icarus" was printed in the June 13, 1868, issue of *Scientific American* to promote a number of prizes to be awarded by the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, which was formed in 1866 to advance the study of aerial navigation. As noted by the very first sentence, there was considerable interest in aeronautics in the 1860s, with a number of articles appearing in earlier issues of this magazine.

The exhibition at the Crystal Palace opened on June 25, 1868, and ran for nine days. It comprised "seventy-seven exhibits, including light engines, models, both lighter- and heavier-than-air (mostly designed to be propelled by screws or fans, and with some of which working demonstrations were given), kites, and plans of aerial machines" (*The History of Aeronautics in Great Britain* by John Edmund Hodgson). The prize of &#163;100 for the lightest engine in proportion to its power was won by John Stringfellow. To my knowledge, the other prizes were not awarded.
