"Ueber Flugmaschine des Uhrmachers Jakob Degen in Wien" is one of four articles on Jakob Degen found in volume 30 of *Annalen der Physik*, and it is the main article describing Degen's flying machine. It was published on August 26, 1808. Johann Christoph Stelzhammer, who was a clergyman, physicist, and the director of the Physikalisches Kabinett in Vienna, begins the article by saying that Degen showed him the initial sketch of his flying machine three years prior to the publication of this article. It is Degen's goal to show that a significant portion of a person's body weight can be lifted using artificial wings.

Degen is described by Stelzhammer as being of a short stature, elderly, and not properly prepared for strenuous exertion. His weight is listed as 119 pounds and that of the machine as 25 pounds. Degen's first trials used a counterweight of 100 pounds to help with lift, and this was later reduced to 75 pounds. The counterweight hung from a rope over two fixed pulleys, and a carriage three feet in length was also used to control movement in the oblique direction.

Degen was able to move his wings in small arcs and remain hovering in the air. To descend gracefully, he would extend the wings so that they acted as a parachute. The next step was to conduct experiments outdoors without the aid of counterweights. Degen's plan was to attach a balloon filled with hydrogen gas to his flying machine. The diameter of the balloon was to be 19 feet 5 inches according to his calculations. Ballast would prevent the balloon from rising too high. This experiment was going to be conducted in the autumn of 1808.

The article ends with a description of the flying machine itself, which is shown in the figure below. The rods, except for those on which the handles are attached and on which the feet rest, are constructed of bamboo and reed. The threads and cords are made of silk. The wings are made of fine paper coated with varnish and the tail of taffeta. The feathers that help raise the wings are made of steel and curve upwards. The length of one wing is 10 feet 4 inches. The greatest width is 9 feet. The surface area of both wings together is 108 square feet, and the surface area of the tail is 8 square feet. Each wing is divided into 3500 flaps, which are arranged in 30 cirles and 48 arcs. The flaps all have the same length of 1 inch but have unequal widths, the narrowest being 1 inch and the widest 7 inches. The flaps are attached to hinges made of taut silk threads, and this is how they are connected to the reed tubes. On the shoulders of the person flying the machine is a metal sheet, and from each shoulder there are bamboo tubes that act as levers and attach to the middle of the wing. The space between the wings is filled with taffeta, but these strips can only be moved indirectly by the wings to which they are attached.

The flying machine hands from a silk cord. Additional cords attached to the person's body are fastened above his head to a ring and connected to the hanging silk cord. From the metal plate on his shoulders, four straps run downwards, cross over his chest and back, and are connected to a small saddle located between his legs. These straps prevent the metal plate from being pulled away from his shoulders by the wings. He then sets the machine in flight using a sort of jumping motion.

Wooden soles are strapped to the bottom of the person's shoes, with brass discs on the underside. Other steel discs and pins are used to secure the flyer's feet so that they remain in place during the flapping and jumping motions. They can be released at the flyer's discretion. Before the flight begins, the flyer lies down, then quickly raises both arms and feet. After completing the "jump," he quickly extends his hands, arms, and feet downwards. He continues this jumping motion until the ring attached to the thin rope above his head touches the ceiling. As he falls, his feet are bent so that the wings, which are fully extended, are not pulled downwards by the bar on which his feet are resting.

The number of wingbeats required to raise Degen to the ceiling, which was 50 feet above him, was not always the same. An average of 34 wingbeats can be assumed, and the time it took to reach the ceiling was 30 seconds. However, Stelzhammer also says that he saw Degen reach the ceiling in 25 wingbeats. On average, one wingbeat results in an altitude gain of 18 inches.

An addendum from *Vossische Zeitung*, printed in Berlin, was added below this main article. It states that the watchmaker Jakob Degen saw a balloon rising in the Prater amusement park and wondered if a person could, using their own strength and with the aid of mechanics, rise into the air, stay aloft, turn at will, and move about. From that time on, he observed the flights of birds, examined the structure of their bodies and wings, and measured and dissected them to determine the ratio of wings to body. He then came up with a flying machine suitable for the human body.

He made a pair of large wings, which bear some resemblance to the wings of a beetle. They consist of a skeletion of light cane, which is interwoven with folded flaps of colorful paper, alternating red and yellow. The finest paper is used, and it covers the entire surface in an even texture. The flaps are connected by fine silk threads and are moveable so that they unfold and spread when movement occurs. In this way, the wings can catch the wind much like real wings. Each wing is attached to a simple device of thin rods at the top, and both hang together via a thin wooden ring that is fastened around the neck of the airman. By using both the feet and hands, the airman moves the wings. The width and length of the wings depends on the weight of the airman.

The experiments from the year prior (i.e., 1807) showed that Degen was indeed able to lift himself off the earth. However, the machine was still too imperfect and his physical strength too weak to keep him aloft and reach a considerable height. He then connected his machine to a weight that was attached to a cord hanging from the ceiling of a hall and compensated for the lack of his strength. A counterweight of 50 pounds was enough to lift Degen to a considerable height and keep him there. This newspaper lists Degen's weight as 150 pounds.

His second attempt was conducted on April 30, 1808, in the presence of many spectators at the Reitschule in Vienna. He rose twice to the ceiling, which was at a height of 54 feet. He kept himself in the air for several seconds, made arbitrary turns, and moved horizontally back and forth.

The final paragraph of the addendum states that Degen is working on a more powerful machine that will allow him to fly into the air and remain there without the aid of counterweights. He wants to attach a small balloon to his machine, one that merely helps with the intial launch. The more he exerts his strength to beat the wings, the higher he will fly. If his strength weakens and he wishes to remain in his current position in the air, he may let his wings flutter freely. This, along with the balloon, will support him. If he wishes to turn and move forward, his wings can be used in the same manner as birds use theirs, and Degen has already demonstrated this movement with his wings. If he wishes to descend, he release the air from the balloon, and he falls, protected by his wing, in the same manner as using a parachute.

The third article is also an addendum, titled "Etwas &#252;ber die Flugmaschine des Herrn Degen in Wien." It was written in October of 1808 by Johann Joseph Prechtl, a well-known technologist and educator. It is a bit tongue-in-cheek, and Prechtl appears skeptical of the whole thing. He begins by saying that Degen's flying machine has been the subject of much talk for some time. Both local and foreign newspapers have reported on it and how it can save on "precious postage" or bring Earthlings to more suitable climates. And the community of watchmakers must be thrilled that an Icarus is among them.

Prechtl was told by several eyewitnesses that Degen's idea for this machine came from studying the flight of birds and, in particular, from the structure of beetles. Prechtl himself conducted numerous studies into bird flight, along with many dissections of birds, from bats to falcons, which has allowed him to gain precise knowledge into the flight mechanism of birds. Based on the eyewitness accounts and an illustration of Degen's machine, Prechtl concludes that Degen's machine bears no resemblance to the flight apparatus of birds. Despite some resemblence to the elytra of beetles, these shells do not enable beetles to fly. A beetle's wings are very delicate and consist of a fine membrane stretched between very thin joints. Degen's machine, on the other hand, is designed with many paper flaps that open downwards and are opened and closed using many threads. In Degen's wing design, there is too much resistance in the backwards movement. Prechtl says that the flight mechanism of birds is so advanced that humans must recognize that developing something as good as or better than it is beyond our limits. Degen's machine, therefore, is not a good approximation of something that would allow humans to enter the realm of birds.

Degen rises in the air using a counterweight of 75 pounds. Degen and the machine weigh 144 pounds together. Thus, he manages to overcome a load of 69 pounds, or 78 pounds including friction, using the downward movement of his wings. Prechtl praises this effort, saying that Degen has shown before a crowd that it is possible to overcome a load of 69 pounds and rise through the air. If the dimensions were known ot Prechtl, he could have calculated the load that could be lifted with the wings using his findings on the absolute resistance of air (see vol. 23, page 130 of *Annalen der Physik*). It would also be possible to calculate the necessary counterweight. Degen determined the value using experiments. There are also other factors, such as the flapping angle, wingbeats per second, and strength of the muscles, that would determine the size and shape of the wings. Degen lacks the mathematical knowledge for this task, which is more necessary here than for watchmaking.

Prechtl is against the idea of attaching a balloon to Degen's machine. The horizontal movement of the balloon by the wind would be too great for the wings to overcome. Degen's machine lacks the mechanisms that allow birds to maintain flight in the horizontal plane. While Degen has shown that the wings can be used as a parachute during a fall, this was done during an indoors test, where he fell from a height of about 50 feet and was kept suspended by a rope.

From all this, Precthl says, it follows that Degen's experiments offer no benefit to the study of flight or air resistance. Even with improvements, Degen would never be able to fly freely through the air. He would have to abandom his ideas and adopt proven ones. Degen is certainly enthusiastic about the problem of flight, and he would be much more useful if he received proper instruction and training. Prechtl wrote to Degen giving him more detailed instructions of how to build the machine, but it is unclear if Degen ever took the advice. As Prechtl says, it is hard to dissuade men once they have enthusiastically embraced an idea.

Prechtl ends by saying it is very possible for humans to rise into the air like birds. He offers to build, with the help of some money and a skilled worker, a machine that can glide through the air like a falcon. Despite Degen's shortcomings in advancing flight, credit must be given to him for bringing this subject to the attention of the general public.

The fourth and final piece about Degen is a letter from Prechtl to Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert, the editor of *Annalen der Physik* from 1799 to 1824. It is titled "Ueber Degen's neuesten Flugversuch in Verbindung mit einem Luftballon" and was written on November 15, 1808. Prechtl wrote an article on the theory of flying in volume 19 and an essay on air resistance in volume 23 of *Annalen der Physik*, which prompted him to write this letter. He mentions how Degen's plan to attach a balloon to his flying machine is a bad one because of the forces acting on a balloon during flight.

Degen did, however, carry out an experiment using a balloon on November 13, 1808, at the Prater. It was done in front of a crowd, though in ideal conditions. The balloon had a diameter of 19 feet, and a lifting force of 31 pounds according to Degen. The balloon was roughly in equilibrium with the air. Only a small movement from the wings was needed to elevate the machine. Degen was able to rise to a height of 150 feet by flapping the wings and then descend. The balloon was attached to a pole with a rope, which kept the balloon vertical in the presence of the wind. Without this precaution, Degen would have been dragged across the ground and trees in strong winds. Prechtl concludes that Degen's machine is still far too imperfect.

This volume of *Annalen der Physik* has the original wrappers bound in. Ownership/library stamps indicate it was held at Deutsche Akademie der Luftfahrtforschung, followed by the Wright Field Library in Dayton, OH, and finally the Library of Congress.
