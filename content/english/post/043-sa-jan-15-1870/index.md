This short article, titled "Aerial Navigation," was written by T. A. Huffer, from "La Fayette, Ind." It deals with the navigation of aerial vessels using the same principles as a ship moving through the water. The full article is given below.

"MESSRS. EDITORS:&mdash;I have been a constant reader of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN for years, and I must say that there is no publication of the day that I read with equal pleasure and profit. I have been very much interested in the articles on aerial navigation. My sympathies and best wishes are with the men who are now exploring this field, and, notwithstanding the many failures in attempts to navigate the air, I believe it will yet be accomplished. I wish here to call attention to the false argument of the *Philadelphia Bulletin*, as quoted in the second article on aerial navigation. We quote: 'A ship is steered in the water because the action of the wind on the sails, and of the hull in the water, can be brought to counteract with each other by means of the rudder. Now, a flying machine is in but one element, and, hence, can never be steered.'

"Now, the fallacy of this argument must be apparent to every one who gives it the least attention. We have yet to learn that the two elements are necessary in order to the steering of a ship. It will not be denied that this is true of sail vessels, which depend upon the wind for motive power; but when this motive power is stored in the vessel in the form of powerful engines, the one medium alone is used, both for propulsion and steering, and the vast difference claimed in the above quoted remarks, between the propulsion and steering of a vessel in water, and that of an aerial ship, is not nearly so apparent as when illustrated by a sailing vessel. On the contrary, by taking a steam ship as the embodiment of the principles sought to be applied to aerial ships, it will be seen that the cases are completely analogous. If, then, the navigation of the air, by a steam vessel, is governed by the same principles as the navigation of water by steam vessels, what are the means necessary to apply those principles to the proposed object?

"It is well known that the speed of a vessel steering against a curret [sic], depends upon the excess of space passed over by the paddles or propeller, in their revolutions, to that of the current in the same time. In other words, the velocity of the circumference of the paddle wheels must be greater than the velocity of current. If the two be equal, it is apparent that no progress can be made&mdash;the vessel will drift upon the current. Neither can the vessel be guided. But, by increasing the velocity of the paddles sufficiently above that of the current, progress and direction are at once attained.

"Now, the mechanical principles here employed to propel a vessel against a current of water would, if applied to the analogous case of the aerial ship, be productive of like results. But these principles must be largely extended in their application to the latter case if satisfactory results be reached. We regard the general conditions necessary to success, to be:

"1st. Engines constructed with a view to economy of space and fuel, the minimum of weight and the maximum of power.

"2d. Propellers of large area compared to the size of the ship, and working at high velocities&mdash;rudder of like proportions.

"3d. Gas holder of sufficient capacity to give ample bouyancy, and of a form presenting the least possible resistance to the air.

"We think there is little danger of going too far in either of the directions indicated. These conditions complied with, success will result."
