The first article is a short one and is about a device invented by Watson Fell Quimby, who was born on December 15, 1825, near Brandywine Springs, New Castle county, Delaware. He studied at Westtown and Haverford schools and graduated from Jefferson Medical College (now Sidney Kimmel Medical College) in 1847. He started practicing medicine in Mobile, Alabama, and went to California in 1849 and lived for some years in mountain camps. He returned to Wilmington in 1852. In 1915, he was still a practicing phyisican at the age of 90 (*Genealogical History of the Quinby (Quimby) Family in England and America* by Henry Cole Quinby).

The same book on the Quimby family shows that W. F. Quimby had five patents related to aviation. They include an "apparatus for navigating the air" (no. 2973, granted November 26, 1861), three patents on flying machines (no. 68789, granted September 10, 1867; no. 95513, granted October 5, 1869; and no. 132022, granted October 8, 1872), and one for an "aerial ship" (no. 218573, granted August 12, 1879).

The full article, titled "Aerial Navigation," is given below.

"Somebody has defined man to be a species of featherless birds. The inventor of the device illustrated herewith has aimed to supply our natural deficiencies in this respect by the provision of wings and tail, attached and operated as indicated. We hardly think he will be able to compete with the swallows in this harness, and would advise him to start from some low point at first, so that, if he should fall down, it will not hurt him much. However, we may say that the principle of calling into play the strong muscles of the thighs to aid the arms in the movement of wings, as shown, is taking advantage of the greatest power the human body can exert, and in this respect the device is an improvement upon some other attempts. The method of connecting the rope to the various parts of the wing, is also such as gives least strain to the various parts. The machine is the invention of W. F. Quimby, of Wilmington, Del."

The next article, also titled "Aerial Navigation," talks about an abandoned flying machine at Novelty Iron Works in New York City. In 1870, the ironworking firm closed, and the machinery was all removed. The entire floor of the main building was empty, except that "in the center [stood] a flying machine." The inventor of this machine is unknown. The watchman said that the machine had been there for six weeks or more, but as the author of the article states, "a watchman's judgment ... is not generally very reliable on such matters." The author then describes the machine.

"It is designed to be driven by steam. A two-horse power vertical boiler is supported in a light frame at the bottom of the machine. At one side of the top of this frame is placed one of Root's rotary engines&#185;. On the shaft of this engine is a miter gear, which meshes into the two others, one at the top and another at the bottom of the gear on the engine shaft. The two driven gears are respectively keyed to a solid shaft and a hollow shaft, the former rising vertically through the latter. Thus equal but reverse motion is secured in the two shafts.

"Each shaft carries a propeller screw made of light metallic frame work, with blades of canvas stretched over skeleton frames of iron. The arms of the wings or blades are of hollow brass tubing, tapering from their junction with the shafts to the extremeties of the wings. They are braced laterally and vertically by small iron rods. We judge the diameter of the counter propellers thus formed to be about twenty feet.

"The object of giving them reverse motion is evidently to prevent the machine from spinning around on its vertical axis, as would be the case if only one propeller were employed.

"These propellers must, if revolved rapidly, exert considerable elevating power, but the weight of the machine is evidently greater than their capacity, unless they are revolved at a velocity that would break some part of the machinery."

The author ends by saying that the problem of flying machines is going to be solved by the discovery of materials that are strong as well as light and also by the invention of a more powerful motor.
