This article by Theodore Poesche describes an unusual idea to use a modern steamer and adapt it for travel through the air. In his mind, the ship should be long and slender, with a length to width ratio of twenty to one. The means of propulsion is a screw driven by steam power. This screw is much larger than what is used for nautical purposes, and it should have "12 blades of boiler iron." Every blade has "the strip of a cylindrical plane, the axis of which would coincide with that of the propeller, in order to prevent the too rapid escape of the air." The ship has a flat bottom and runs on broad wheels of a short diameter when being propelled on land.

To ascend, the ship uses large inclined planes of double glued canvas, *d* in the figure below, stretched over iron frames, *e*. This acts in a manner similar to the plane of a kite. The planes turn on iron axes, *f*. An iron rod is used to turn these axes and control the angle of inclination. The angle of the planes controls the ascension and descension of the ship.

As Poesche states, "my ship most nearly resembles the flying fish, which progresses by means of the spiral action of the tail, while its extended fins support it for a time in the air." He argues that, for the same weight, the power to move a vessel through the air is the same as the power required to move it in the water. He ends by saying that a better source of motive power for aerial navigation, such as carbonic acid, may one day be discovered.

According to an issue of *Scientific American* from April 9, 1853, there also exists a pamphlet detailing Poesche's plans, and it includes some engravings. The review states that there is no rational ground for Poesche's idea to work; the screw was proposed before for aerial navigation with balloons but did not work. The reviewer suggests Poesche conduct a demonstration of his idea to silence any critics.

Theodore Poesche was born at Zoeschen, near Merseburg, and graduated from the University of Halle. He moved to England after participating in the German revolution of 1848. He moved to the United States in 1850 and to Washington, D. C., in 1857, where he worked as a statistician at the U. S. Treasury for forty years. He does not appear to have had any formal training in engineering or the sciences. He died on December 27, 1899.

The Franklin Institute was founded in 1824 and was important to the research of steam engines, among other areas, during the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The *Journal of the Franklin Institute* was first published in 1826 and was a way to disseminate research and discoveries across various scientific and engineering disciplines. This particular volume was once held at the University of New Hampshire and contains the university library's bookplate.
