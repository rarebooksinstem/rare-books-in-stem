*Dissertation sur les a&#233;rostates des anciens et des modernes* is an exceedingly scarce work on the history of ballooning, containing myths, legends, and recorded flight attempts. It was printed in Geneva in 1784 and was written by A. G. Rozier. In *The History of Aeronautics in Great Britain*, John Hodgson notes that this work is "also attributed to A. G. Robert."

Rozier states in the introduction that, if one studies historical attempts to raise balloons using gas and fire, it can be concluded that the Montgolfier brothers were not the first to invent the hot air balloon. He then proceeds to give several examples throughout history where lighter-than-air flight was acheived.

The first chapter is dedicated to what the ancients knew about flammable gas or air. The author argues that early legends have some elements of truth to them. For example, Daedalus flew from Crete to Sicily, which, while impossible to do solely with the strength of one's arms, means he had the help of some kind of flying machine. Daedalus was said to have a vast knowledge of physics and mathematics and was able to create marvels such as moving statues. Furthermore, during Plato's time, they knew about gas, making it possible that it was used by Daedalus. Another example Rozier gives is that of Archytus' wooden dove. Quoting Favorinus, "Archytus of Tarentum, philosopher and skilled mechanic, constructed a wooden dove that flew and did not rise again once it had fallen." Rozier also discusses the use of different types of fire used by the ancients to lift objects into the air, though the ancients undoubtedly realized, he says, that providing a constant supply of fire was challenging because of weight considerations.

The second section talks about people who have used air and fire to rise into the air. It seeks to prove that the knowledge of flammable air is not new and that stories of men descending from the clouds are not fiction. One such story is that of Remigius. When he was duumvir, he condemned two hundred people who had been convicted of sorcery to die by fire. They took him to a pond and struck the water with a rod that had been given to them by a demon. This caused a large amount of vapor that carried the entire crowd into the air. There is also the story of Pausanias, who describes a fountain in Aracadia where it was enough to stick an oak branch into the water for a thick cloud to form; the cloud then ascended and attracted other clouds to it, and soon it all turned into rain.

Saxo Grammaticus wrote about the Danish pirate Otto, who could travel through the air without a ship and could stir up hurricanes and storms that destroyed enemy fleets. Jean Froissart recalls a story of a count of Burgundy who wanted to take control of a citadel near Naples. A magician promised to create a cloud that would act as a bridge that his soldiers could cross and descend over the citadel's walls. However, his demands in return for his services were seen as diabolical, and the count had him killed. There are several other such stories to be found in the second section. Rozier states that one can perform meteorological operations using certain minerals, which, while appearing to be magic, can be attributed to natural means. The stories of flying people, therefore, can be attributed to using vapors inside globes and other objects to attain flight. There were even reports of people flying into space during the end of Charlemagne's reign.

The third section deals with obstacles preventing people from flying safely through the air and the challenges with propelling and directing aerostats. Rozier describes several failed attempts at flight, including those involving artificial wings. It is in this section that Rozier describes the problems with Francesco Lana's airship made of copper spheres.

The fourth and final section deals with the uselessness and dangers of aerostats. One danger is the social aspect of aerostats. While the rich and the physicists can afford to sacrifice their time and money to flight, the poorer citizens cannot. It is therefore necessary to prove that the farmers and craftsmen can build and fly machines just as easily as the rich. For certain classes of people, Rozier says that aerostats are completely useless. At first glance, commerce may benefit from this invention, but merchants will have pay for the use of aerostats and accept the risks that come with flying. Aerostats have no advantage in war, either, if both sides have access to them.

Rozier ends by saying that the inventors/builders of these "ridiculous" machines will never be able to use them and will have to deal with the exposing themselves to the greatest dangers. Once in the air, if the aeronaut doesn't descend quickly, the wind or fire may take his life. The final fifteen pages contain a list of authors that Rozier mentions in this book.
