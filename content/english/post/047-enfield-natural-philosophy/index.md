William Enfield wrote *Institutes of Natural Philosophy, Theoretical and Experimental* as a textbook for students at the Warrington Academy, which was a teaching establishment from 1756 to 1782 and where Enfield taught. He focuses on topics dealing with the "mechanic philosophy" and leaves out anything to do with chemistry because it is "yet too imperfectly understood." The work is divided into seven "books." In order, the books cover material on matter, mechanics, hydrostatics and pneumatics, optics, astronomy, magnetism, and electricty. Much of the material is presented in the form of definitions and propositions, and when necessary, Enfield makes use of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. When writing this book, Enfield consulted works by Isaac Newton, John Keill, William Whiston, Willem Gravesande, Roger Cotes, Robert Smith, Richard Helsham, John Rowning, and Thomas Rutherforth.

Enfield was best known as a minister. Many of his publications have to do with sermons and elocution. In "about 1770," he became "tutor in the *Belles Lettres*" (*The Theological and Miscellaneous Works of Joseph Priestly*, volume 22, by Joseph Priestly and John Towill Rutt). In 1774, he took over the mathematics position at Warrington, though he did not enjoy this new responsibility because it was not an area he was comfortable with (*The Story of Warrington* by Bill Cooke). *Institutes of Natural Philosophy, Theoretical and Experimental* proved to be a successful work. The second edition was printed in 1799, and several more editions were printed in London and Boston in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. *The Monthly Review; or, Literary Journal* said in its February, 1786, issue that Enfield's work contains "all that is most necessary to be known on the these subjects, and delivered in a very demonstrative and perspicuous manner."  

This work contains eleven plates, some of which are shown below. This copy comes from Birmingham Library and is bound in &#188; leather with marbled boards.
