John Whalley's *Ptolemy's Quadripartite* is the first English translation of Ptolemy's work on astrology written by him during the 2<sup>nd</sup> century. As stated on the title page, this work is actually a translation from Leo Allatius' Latin translation of Ptolemy, and Whalley notes that other sources in Greek and Latin were also consulted. In J. M. Ashmand's *Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos*, the preface states that Whalley's book "has been long removed from general sale; and its gross misinterpretation of the author, caused by the carelessness or ignorance of Whalley and his assistants, by whom it was produced, has rendered most of its pages unintelligible: its absence is, therefore, scarcely to be regretted." A second edition of this work was printed in 1786, and Ashland once again notes that it was not "purified from the blunders and obscurities which disgraced its predecessor."

John Whalley was born on April 29, 1653, and died on January 17, 1724. He lists himself as student in "Astrology and Physick" on the title page of this work. A similar statement appears in some of his other books. *A History of the City of Dublin* by Sir John Thomas Gilbert says that Whalley was "the chief quack and astrologer of this time in the city." He was a shoemaker by trade and came to Dublin in 1682 and "gained such a reputation for necromancy." He was also a "compiler of prophetic almanacs" and "compounder of medicines to cure all diseases." As a Protestant, he denounced Catholicism and railed against the native Irish, which made him very unpopular. His last almanac was published in 1724, the year of his death and which he called the "year of darkness" given the expected eclipse. After his death, his widow Mary Whalley continued publishing his almanacs for some time. 

This copy contains some interesting marginalia, with corrections and notes by a previous owner. A couple of examples are given below.

The back of the book contains a page of errata along with advertisements for Whalley's *A Treatise on Eclipses* and William Wright's *A Brief Exposition of the Thirteenth Chapter of the Revelations*. Both of these books were printed by Whalley at his printing house on St. Nicholas Street in Dublin.
