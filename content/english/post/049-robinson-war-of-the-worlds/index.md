While this work shares the same title as H. G. Well's novel, that is where the similarities end. Frederick Robinson's *The War of the Worlds: A Tale of the Year 2,000 A. D.* is a tale envisioning life and war almost a century after its publication in 1914. It appears to be self-published.

The story involves the sailor Rabinoff, who comes across an island filled with diamonds. He kills the rest of the small crew and keeps the diamonds for himself. He eventually amasses a wealth in the billions of dollars. He then asks a woman from New York City to marry him, but she rejects him. This causes him to conspire with several other nations around world to attack New York City. He even manages to enlist the help of the Martians, who provide him with superior airships. In the end, America comes out on top, and Rabinoff ends up jumping off his airship to his death to avoid capture.

Among the more interesting bits are the descriptions of what the future looks like. New York City is the wealthiest and most powerful city in the world. It is described as having been expanded upwards into the sky as well as downward beneath the earth. The tallest skyscraper is 150 stories high and 30 stories deep. The streets have moving sidewalks. Horses are almost extinct and are no longer used for transportation. Instead, aeroplanes, aero-taxis, aero-buses, and aero-trucks are used for day-to-day transportation and have replaced automobiles. An underground network of trains is used for heavy hauling. Businessmen and rich people take luxurious aeroplanes to and from work, and these are driven by air-chauffeurs. Police patrol the city using aeroplanes as well, though there was little crime because "eugenics and the scientific breeding of humanity...had all but eliminated the defective and the criminal." Men of lesser means had to make do with old-fashioned Bleriot monoplanes or Wright biplanes.

The other fascinating part is the description of the world. The United States now includes Canada and Mexico and retains Hawaii and the Philippines. Great Britain is still a great power even though India gained its independence and controls much of Africa. The interior and western parts of Africa are now a big country called Africana. Germany is the dominant power in Europe and includes Prussia, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and bits of other nations. Franconia includes France, Italy, and Spain. Russia is basically the same as before. Greece is now part of Roumogaria, which includes the old Balkan nations. India has broken off from Great Britain and is a great power. Persia has expanded and includes several neighboring states. The rest of the countries have been absorbed by China. Japan now includes many of the neighboring islands. Australia has developed into a great nation and is as densely populated as Europe was in 1900. Finally, South America has split into two nations, Chili and Argentina.

Robinson was perhaps a better artist than a writer. The handful of illustrations found in the book were done by him. Below are four illustrations depicting aerial battles and the death of Rabinoff.

I was able to find the following information about Robinson. Volume 13 of *Southwest Contractor and Manufacturer* from 1914 mentions that "Frederick Robinson has had work started on the construction of the 'War of the Worlds' concession, one of the largest that will be built on the Isthmus on the exposition grounds. The construction and equipment will involve much concrete and cement work, carpentry, about eleven miles of electric wire, wireless apparatus, 28 ships, etc." It is assumed that this was intended for the Panama-California Exposition that was held in San Diego between January 1, 1915, and January 1, 1917. It also mentions that work would be started on two other concessions, "Water Carnival" and "Pharoah's Daughter." All three concessions were said to be owned by Frederick Robinson Amusement Co. in Chicago. While no other references to a Frederick Robinson Amusement Co. could be found, there are several other references to a Frederick Robinson Exhibition Co. in Riverview Park in Chicago. The February 17, 1917, edition of *Moving Picture World and View Photographer* (found in volume 31) says that "Mr. Robinson is an artist, illustrator and author of international fame. He is also famous as the creator and producer of such spectacles as 'The Battle of the Monitor and the Merrimac,' 'The Sinking of the Titanic' and 'The War of the Worlds.'"
