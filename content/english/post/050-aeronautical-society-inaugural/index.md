This handbill contains an address by James Glaisher establishing the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain. The inaugural meeting was held at George Campbell's (Duke of Argyll) residence in Campden Hill, London, on January 12, 1866. It was attended by "six men interested in scientific and mechanical problems" (*The History of Aeronautics in Great Britain* by John Edmund Hodgson).

Glaisher states in his address that ballooning "has scarcely occupied the attention of scientific men." It was his hope that the establishment of an aeronautical society would make the field of aeronautics "take its standing among the sciences." At that time, the field of aeronautics had some experiments and studies from which to gather data from. Still, there was much to be discovered regarding "atmospheric currents, temperature, and phenomena of storms," among other things.

The balloon was, according to Glaisher, capable of helping answer those questions, and "a chief branch of enquiry by the Society would be the department relating to the mechanical expedients and inventions for facillitating aerial navigation, and obtaining or aiding a change of locality at the will of the aeronaut." Despite the abundance of examples in nature of flying insects and birds, "it seems remarkable that no correct demonstration has ever been given of the combined principles upon which flight is performed, nor of the absolute force required to maintain that flight." The goal of this society, then, was to bring forward theories and experiments related to the science of aeronautics.

Glaisher was a famous balloonist and made numerous ascents to measure the temperature and humdity at very high altitudes, including one at over 28,000 feet. He was elected Honorary Treasurer of the Aeronautical Society at a meeting held exactly one month after the inaugural meeting. The Duke of Argyll was elected the first President of the society at this meeting.
