### 1. What areas do you primarily collect?

I primarily collect early aviation (pre-Wright Brothers), physics, engineering, math, ornithology, navigation, horology, and navigation material. My collection does have some science fiction in it, especially anything related to early flight.

### 2. Where do you get your material from?

I primarily buy online from dealers, and I use vialibri.net to search for material. Many of the dealers I buy from are members of organizations like the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America (ABAA) and the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB).

### 3. Are your books for sale?

No. This site is intended to catalog my collection. If you're looking to buy a particular book and have questions, feel free to email me, and I'll try to help.

### 4. How can I contact you?

You can email me at rarebooksinstem@gmail.com.
