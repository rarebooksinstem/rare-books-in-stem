It is fitting that my first post be about the book that got me interested in early aviation. It is the first edition of Thomas Walker's A Treatise Upon the Art of Flying, printed in Hull in 1810. This particular copy is inscribed by Walker to a Tho. Jaques, and auction records show this exact copy came up for sale back in 19XX.

Little is known about Walker's life. The title page lists his occupation as a portrait painter.

The Aeronautical Society of Great Britain reprinted this work in The Aeronautical Classics, in which both editions of this work appear. In the foreword, the following is written about Walker: 
> His sole claims to immortality are the two editions of his pamphlet upon flying, which exhibit him as an earnest amateur with a hobby and some small conceit of himself. He fumbles with great truths: knows much, but fails to order his knowledge, and hovers on the brink of great achievements in a way that is quite exasperating. For these reasons his writings are, perhaps, the most fascinating of all those of the pioneers.

In the second edition, Walker notes the considerable interest in this subject. Copies of the first edition of his work were taken to mainland Europe and America. The first American edition appeared in 1814 and was reprinted in 1816.
